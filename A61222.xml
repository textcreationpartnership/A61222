            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Courteous READER.</head>
            <p>THE Subject of this enſuing Book <hi>(A Call to all the Inhabitants of the Earth, to turn immediately to the Lord their God)</hi> is Great and Good. Even what all the Words and Preaching that have ever came forth into the World, in all the ſeveral Generations and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, have endeavoured at.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for Sins, the Juſt for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, that he might bring us to God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 8. Beſides the Sufferings of Chriſt, The End and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of all the Words which Chriſt ſpake or made known, and ſo it is the ſame of all the Tranſactions which have ever paſſed between God and Man, are, that he might <hi>bring us</hi> to Himſelf, who is
<pb facs="tcp:102492:3"/> God. Though this hath been indeed effected of ſome few Peculiar People of the ſeveral Generations, yet it hath not been of the Multitude and Generality of Mankind. Notwithſtanding God was manifeſted in the Fleſh, and put to Death in the Fleſh, but quickned in the Spirit for this alone End and Purpoſe. How can it then be expected, that one who is born out of due Time, and the leaſt of all in the Kingdom of God, can, by publiſhing a few words more, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh ſo great a thing, when all the Books and Preaching in the World have not yet done it? Eſpecially when the <hi>Word</hi> it ſelf, which was made Fleſh and dwelt among us, <hi>Full of Grace and Truth,</hi> who ſpake as never Man ſpake, did not ſo bring it to paſs that all ſhould, though ſome did believe on him. Far be it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from me to expect or imagine, That this little Book or Treatiſe of mine, will ever have ſo great an Effect.</p>
            <p>But it is only offered as another <hi>Mile</hi> to be thrown into the Treaſury of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths. It is the Thoughts of one ſingle Creature which have aroſe in his
<pb facs="tcp:102492:3"/> Mind, whereby himſelf is actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to God and good things, and to turn unto the Lord <hi>Immediately,</hi> Luke 12. 36. As <hi>Paul</hi> conferred not with Fleſh and Blood, but immediately went to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> So for my part I would utterly lay aſide all Carnal and Worldly Conſiderations, and immediately give up my ſelf to the Guidance of the Lord, as he leads me in the way to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that is above, whitherſoever that way goes. And I do deſire that theſe ſame Thoughts may be publiſhed and made known abroad; Out of this Hope and Expectation, If Peradventure the God of all Truth, who perſwadeth us through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our Life, in all the ſeveral Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Conditions thereof, That we may be able to perſwade other Men and Women by the very ſame Thoughts wherewith our ſelves are perſwaded of God. <hi>He faſhioneth the Hearts of the Sons of Men alike,</hi> Pſal. 33. 15. and it is commonly ſeen, That by what one is perſwaded, another under the like Thoughts and Circumſtances is <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded</hi> alſo. And if the like things
<pb facs="tcp:102492:4"/> were made known unto, and believed by the mixt Multitude and generality of Mankind, as is to the elect People and real Servants of God, in all outward Likelihood and Probability, They would alſo be brought over unto God.</p>
            <p>To this alone End and Purpoſe are theſe Words laid before Men, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. will may read. And for ſuch who will not read, the Saying among the <hi>Latins</hi> is, <hi>Pertinaciae nullum Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium Poſuit Deus;</hi> So we the Miniſters of his Word cannot tell what to ſay to it; Nor do we know how to help and remedy it though we would never ſo fain. But we can only warn ſuch, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ye Deſpiſers, and Wonder and Periſh.</hi> Such are in real danger to fall under the ſame Doom as the Sons of <hi>Eli</hi> and <hi>Amaziah</hi> did. <hi>Notwithſtanding they beark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not unto the Voice of their Father, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord would ſlay them,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 25. <hi>But</hi> Amaziah <hi>would not hear, for it came of God that he might deliver them into the hand of their Enemies,</hi> 2 Chron. 25. 20. And ſo it is, They that will not Hear,
<pb facs="tcp:102492:4"/> Read and Receive the Words of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Knowledge and Reproof, It is a certain foregoing ſign, that ſuch will be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</p>
            <p>It is commonly alledged that there is no new thing under the Sun; and there is nothing ſaid (eſpecially in Books) but what hath been ſaid before; for my part I would endeavour ſomewhat further in what I publiſh to the World (which as yet is not ſo clearly made known in other Books and Sermons) or otherwiſe I would not publiſh at all. Or at leaſt I would <hi>ſeek out accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Words,</hi> and that <hi>which is written may be upright, even Words of Truth,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 10. If Words, or rather Sentences of Truth are indeed brought forth, Although they be without Method and Connexion (as there are very many of this ſort in the following Treatiſe,) yet they are never the leſs worth for want of that: All one as pieces of Gold or ſo many Pearls are not the leſs valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, although they be not linked and
<pb facs="tcp:102492:5"/> chained together. Again, Although my writing here is not with enticing words of Mans Wiſdom, nor yet according to the exact Rules of Oratory; But things are expreſſed ſo plainly, that they may be underſtood by the meaneſt Capacity: Nevertheleſs God is more glorified, and the Reader may be more edified hereby, then in (what is called) more Learned and Polite Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>It was both a puzling and alſo a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Queſtion of <hi>Pilate, What is Truth?</hi> To me it ſeems to be the expreſſing forth the Nature of things as they are, with the Connexion between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and how they pertain to us Men. Things are again divided into Viſible and Inviſible, Preſent or Future. Now the preſent and viſible things ſoon paſs away and are but little. But the great Object of what is commonly called <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth</hi> (which is the ſubject of the enſuing Book) is only inviſible and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things, which are the only thing needful, even the greateſt and neareſt Concern. All things are Gods, for he created them; and the principal Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:102492:5"/> here inſiſted on throughout the whole, is what God requires of Man, with a Word of Exhortation to enforce him the more to the Obedience and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the ſame, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially what God will do unto us Men and Women, the reaſonable Inhabitants of this Earth, both hereon in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter days, and alſo after that they are gone off from this Stage of the middle part of the World.</p>
            <p>As to that great Controverſie which the Lord hath had for ſo many Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations paſt and foregoing, concerning their univerſal Obedience to <hi>Himſelf their God,</hi> Pſal. 50. 7. which all the words that ever came forth and were made known in the World heretofore, have not (I do not ſay could not) <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed and brought to paſs,</hi> How it will be all done ſuddenly and at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, by the pouring out of the Spirit upon us from on High, may be ſeen in Page 295. As alſo that there will be an end of all Wars and of all Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is ſhewed in Page 285, 288. which will be a very great Good to Mankind:
<pb facs="tcp:102492:6"/> So that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>king known theſe things, will tend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>re to the real Benefit of Man, than <hi>ſpending their Money for that which is not Bread,</hi> and their Labour for that which ſatisfieth not, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming ſo much time in other and vain Things.</p>
            <p>I need not ſay much more by way of Preface and Introduction, But here I ſhall only add this further, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God is now pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company and Seal theſe Truths with the droppings and diſtillings of that ſame <hi>Spirit,</hi> which hereafter he will pour out. And according as that ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame Spirit giveth Underſtanding (for it is too common that the Works and Things of God are <hi>not underſtood,</hi> Pſal. 106. 7. Acts 7. 25.) for theſe things are Spiritually diſcerned. As alſo there is a need of a diſtinguiſhing Judgment, as to diſcern and know which are the <hi>real Truths of God,</hi> from the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Sayings of other meer Humane Writers. Again, According as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words of Truth do approve themſelves to the Hearts and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb facs="tcp:102492:6"/> of the Real and <hi>Inward</hi> (ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 29.) and not ſo much to the Nominal and outward Chriſtians: And according as Care, Endeavour, Induſtry and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, are uſed in the publiſhing and making them known, ſo accordingly they will meet with Acceptance or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection from the World.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. The Introduction.</head>
               <p>IF all Mankind of all Generations and Countries were now ſummoned together, and there was a Voice that could reach them all; as God will at the laſt Day <hi>gather all Nations, and will bring them down into the</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102492:10"/> 
                  <hi>Valley of</hi> Jehoſhaphat, <hi>and will plead with them there,</hi> Joel 3. 2. By his own Power and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his Voice: It would be proper to preach and make known theſe Words unto them. But in the mean time he hath ſhewed the Way, and he doth require it of us under the Danger and Penalty of Diſobedience, that all we ſhould <hi>publiſh the Word,</hi> Pſal. 68. 11. which he hath given us, as far as we can. And he hath ſo ordered that the <hi>ſtill Voice</hi> of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhould be ſent forth into the Hearts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People. All things are to be done as far as he hath pointed out, and put into our Power: All we ſhould help whatever we can towards the Furtherance thereof; for the Work of the Lord is common, and ſhould be the joint Endeavour of all his Servants.</p>
               <p>Ever ſince the World began, and down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til this Time, and what futher remains on, the Kingdom <hi>of Heaven ſuffereth Violence,</hi> and the violent take it by Force. According to our Ability we ought ſeverally to the utmoſt of, yea, and beyond our Power to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doing the Will of God; bring Glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Name, to further and carry on with all our Might and Diligence the <hi>common Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to endeavour, by all Means poſſible, yea, our ſelves are to act and ſuffer an holy Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that People may be more brought over and <hi>added unto the Lord.</hi> As God is to be lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the Soul and with all the Strength,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102492:10"/> and with all the Heart, and with all the Mind: So all things we have, or can do, are to be laid out and reſolutely put forth (without any more Intermiſſion or Wearineſs than what is abſolutely neceſſary and requiſite) in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and doing good unto others. None are to be idle; but as we are warned of, ſo ought we to avoid to our utmoſt, that we fall not under the Doom of the unprofitable Servant. <hi>For behold I come quickly, and my Reward is with me to give to every Man according as his Work ſhall be,</hi> Rev. 22. 12. And we having but a ſhort Time, might learn this Wiſdom from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, to improve this our Time to the utmoſt Advantage, to oppoſe and deſtroy his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to <hi>turn People from Darkneſs to Light,</hi> and <hi>from the Power of Satan unto God,</hi> and to recover thoſe that are already taken <hi>captive at his Will.</hi> As he walketh about ſeeking whom he may devour, ſo is the Will of the moſt high God, that his Servants ſhould <hi>run to and fro that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge may be increaſed,</hi> Dan. 12. 4. that many may be converted and ſaved. And when each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is converted, then he is to <hi>ſtrengthen his Brethren,</hi> and to endeavour what lieth in him, that others may be converted alſo; and ſo on. The like Care and Endeavour is to be uſed and ſpread abroad, that <hi>all Men may be ſaved and come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi> Whatever is dictated to any, and is tending to good, the ſame is to be complied with and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102492:11"/> actually done, and ſo on whatever can be reached further, or apprehended more.</p>
               <p>Nothing is created in vain, nor yet ſhould lye ſtill and remain to no Purpoſe, but the ſame ſhould anſwer the very Ends for which each thing was made and ordained. This is to be obſerv'd, not only in natural and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things, but neceſſarily and more eſpecially in eternal and ſpiritual things, and ſo we ſhould <hi>preſs unto the Mark of the high calling.</hi> God hath created and left us in ſuch a State as to prove whether we will do that to which he hath already enabled us, and doth require. If we do not, it is at our Fault and Peril, and we ſhall be ſubject unto Loſs and Miſery. But yet the <hi>Eyes which were made to ſee,</hi> ſhould and may ſee; the Ears to hear; and who have Hearts and Underſtandings given to perceive, they <hi>may perceive,</hi> Deut. 29. 4. As Men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves to be Servants of the moſt high God, ſo they ſhould do his revealed Will, and perform what he hath ſaid in his ſtanding and written Word, by which he now ſpeaketh from Heaven, all one as if we heard out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly his Voice. And then they ſhould <hi>take hold of the Skirt of their Neighbours,</hi> and cauſe them to go and hear the Word of the Lord. Uſing the like Endeavour and Perſwaſion drawn only from divine Arguments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, as the wicked, and Companions in Sin, do entice one another by their Arts and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102492:11"/> Means: Yea, and they ſhould ſo lay hold of them that they ſhall not go back unleſs they rent ſome Piece of their Garments, that they may as it were be <hi>compelled,</hi> Luke 14. 25. to their own Good and Salvation; that if they will ſtill refuſe and give back, it may be with greater Difficulty and Striving: And if they do reſiſt the firſt or ſecond Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet by continual asking and putting in Mind, the ungodly and wicked may be <hi>weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Luke 18. 5. till they firſt hear, and then they will come to receive and yield unto the Words of eternal Life. <hi>Then the Eyes of the Blind ſhall be opened, and the Ears of the Deaf ſhall be unſtopped,</hi> Iſa. 35. 5. <hi>They alſo that erred in Spirit ſhall come to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and they that murmured ſhall learn Doctrine,</hi> Iſa. 29. 24. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at firſt this may be eſteemed uncivil and troubleſome to the Neighbourhood and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, yet is very conſiſtent and agreeable with the Welfare and Happineſs of Mankind, for many to joyn together and ſeverally, that it may be no ſtrange nor ſingular thing, to endeavour in all good Conſcience, and the greateſt Earneſtneſs to bring People off from Ignorance, Sloth and Deadneſs in Sin, to Knowledge, be doing good and the ſpiritual Life; that coming out of carnal Security, they may diſcern and follow the things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their Peace, and thence lead them up to the holy Hill. It can be no Harm to reſcue
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102492:12"/> any from the Place of Torment, to pull him (though never ſo much againſt his Will) like a Brand out of the Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye that make Mention of the Lord; keep not Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; And give him no Reſt till he make</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>a Praiſe in the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 62. 6, 7. So we are to do the like, and endeavour, what we can, to gather the People, and make them <hi>meet and ready,</hi> a <hi>People prepared for the Lord.</hi> Each Maſter of a Family may order the Word of Exhortation and Inſtruction to be read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his whole Houſe: Or where he is backward or negligent, then the Wife of his Boſom, or a Son, or a Servant who is rightly diſpoſed towards God, they ought to give the Houſe no Reſt, but be urgent and importunate till it be made known unto, and underſtood by them. <hi>That as our God hath given Precept upon Precept, Precept up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Precept, Line upon Line, Line upon Line, here a little and there a little,</hi> Iſa. 28. 10. It being doubly ranked, and ſeveral times enforced, yea, and repeated over and over: So it is to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inculcated till it hath gotten the Victory over all rebellious and ſtubborn Hearts.</p>
               <p>And when this or the like Method is uſed (as the Spirit ſhall direct or incline) in our own Nation and every Part thereof, we may <hi>aſſuredly gather,</hi> Acts 16. 10. that God hath called us to preach the Goſpel unto others. <hi>Surely the Iſles ſhall wait for me, and the Ships of</hi> Tarſhiſh <hi>firſt, to bring thy Sons from far, their</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:102492:12"/> 
                  <hi>Silver and Gold with them, unto the Name of the Lord thy God, And to the holy one of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath glorified thee. And the Sons of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſhall build up thy Walls, and their Kings ſhall miniſter unto thee,</hi> Iſa. 60. 9, 10. It hath been the Way and Method of God's gracious deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the Children of Men, to help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Good by little and little, to bring them on from leſs to greater, and ſtill to make beter and <hi>increaſe,</hi> Pſal. 115. 14. their Condition. Who firſt laid the Foundations of the Earth, and ordained the gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Waters; who ſettled the habitable Parts of the Earth, and divided Country from Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by Rivers, Seas, and Rocks, he could have made it all one Continent and Plain: Who gave Life and Motion in ſuch a Degree as now the doth, he might have raiſed it to what Pitch of Activity and Speed he pleaſed: By the ſame Power we might have been made to walk on the Waters, or to ride on an Horſe through the Deep. But he hath eſtabliſhed things in wonderful Wiſdom and Counſel for great and excellent Ends, even in thoſe which ſeem or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and common. <hi>Seeing many things, but thou obſervest not,</hi> Iſa. 42. 20. As God made every thing, ſo he gave Man that Skill and Knowledge to build Boats and Veſſels for the Water, and to ſend forth from one Place to another. Now conſider the utmoſt End and Deſign of Navigation, whether to keep Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and Correſpondence with other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102492:13"/> Deſire of Gain and their Commodities, or to maintain the buſie Nature of Man in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: Yet there is one thing greater than all; that is, to bring down God from above by the Word of Faith, which we preach; that People may be more acquainted with him, to give them Knowledge of Salvation, and tell them of the greater Communion and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of his People, which ſhortly will be more than hath been ever ſince the World began; and in the mean while all things are to be done which may haſten and make ready to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Accompliſhment thereof: To make known the <hi>things which belong to their Peace,</hi> and their eternal Exaltation and Happineſs, which is more than all the Gold of <hi>Ophir.</hi> To aſſure them that they ſhall, and tell them the Way how they may live bleſſed for ever, which is more than the beſt temporal Livelihood: This is the beſt Uſe and End of Navigation.</p>
               <p>If we did look up and could ſee the Heavens opened, that vaſt and wide Place to which the great and wide Sea is not ſo much as a ſmall ſingle Pool of Water is now to the whole Ocean. Every thing above is ſo aſtoniſhing, that all the Wonders of the Deep are not ſo much as the purling of a little Brook or Stream. <hi>To ſee the King in his Beauty, and to behold the Land that is very far off,</hi> Iſa. 33. 17. is infinitely more delightful than the Gaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Eaſtern Emperors, or all the pleaſant Places of all the Earth. Our Souls ſhall mount
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102492:13"/> up there, after they have for ſome time dwelt in this earthly Cottage. They now are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of, and get above all things here, and do apprehend the other by Faith which will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Sight and Enjoyment. God doth all things in his own Order. <hi>O that thou wouldst rent the Heavens, that thou wouldſt come down,</hi> Iſa. 64. 1. He might open and diſplay his own Majeſty, and make himſelf ſeen in his Glory; or he might infuſe his Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit immediately into the Hearts of every Soul of every Nation under Heaven to give them Knowledge and Aſſurance that theſe things are ſo. But he hath ſpoken to the World by the Prophets, his Son, and Apoſtles, who lived in the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and others are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it from them, and to publiſh it forth throughout the World. Thus our Lord and Saviour gave Commiſſion and Direction. And accordingly his Apoſtles did travel about on Horſes and Ships unto the Places afar off to make known theſe things, and ſo their Words went out unto the End of the World. But we, according to his good and gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, do expect a more univerſal preaching of his Word, and ſending of his Spirit. As <hi>He is the Confidence of all the Ends of the Earth, and of them that are are afar off upon the Sea,</hi> Pſal. 65. 5. So he will manifeſt and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fully known unto them. Our ſelves as yet know him by Faith, we hear of him with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102492:14"/> the Hearing of the Ear, we ſee it written of him, we underſtand and perceive from within, but the Words of Life and Knowledge may be ſent and publiſhed unto others. By the Help of Ink and Paper we may ſpeak to thoſe whom we have not ſeen, and to the Nations afar off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Men and Brethren of every Country of the Earth,</hi> let me freely ſpeak unto you of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>David, that he is both dead and buried:</hi> Whilſt he lived, he ruled over one ſingle Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſmall Extent, and he was likely to have been thruſt from that by his Son <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> but the Lord ſuſtained him. He had no forreign and new Conqueſts, nor did he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large Territories. Himſelf was not made the Head of the Heathen, nor did People whom he knew not, ſerve him. Therefore being a Prophet, and knowing that God had ſworn with an Oath to him, that of the Fruit of his Loins according to the Fleſh, God would raiſe up Chriſt to ſit on his Throne; He ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this before, ſpake of the Kingdom of Chriſt, that it ſhould extend over all: He ſhall have Dominion alſo from Sea to Sea, and from the <hi>River unto the Ends of the Earth,</hi> and ſo as is further ſaid in the Seventy Second and Eightieth Pſalms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou haſt delivered me from the Strivings of the People.</hi> It is the general Stile of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies to run in the Preſent or Preterpefect Tenſe; which ſaith things are ready or have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102492:14"/> been, when it ſpeaks of things to come, which denotes the great Truth and Certainty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that it will as really be as if it was at this preſent Moment, or had been already fulfilled. It is the Word and Promiſe of the high and lofty one, who inhabiteth Eternity, to whom all things are preſent and before him: Who ſits above, and hath in his Power the Times and Seaſons. He is above all Difference and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Times, but according to our Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Underſtanding, he expreſſeth himſelf in this wiſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy Hill of</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Ask of me and I ſhall give thee the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for thine Inheritance, and the uttermoſt Parts of the Earth for thy Poſſeſſion,</hi> Pſal. 2. 6, 8. God hath eſtabliſhed his Worſhip and Kingdom by little and little, and ordained that thoſe who ſubmit unto it, ſhould do it freely. It was a conſiderable Time before he brought his firſt Begotten Son into the World, and then he endued him with ſuch Power and Excellency, that others might believe on him as ſent from God, and come to ſerve and honour him; for whoſo doth honour the Son, he doth honour the Father alſo: All People had ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Invitation to come unto him, yet none is forced. His Throne was ſet up in the appointed Place, <hi>for the Law ſhall go forth of</hi> Sion, <hi>and the Word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. <hi>Micah.</hi> 4. 2. Every Man or Woman that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102492:15"/> will, may be obedient to it. We are to fear the <hi>Name of the Lord,</hi> whom we have heard of; and we are to comply with his Will which is made known unto us. Herein is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God ſuperiour and different from that of Men; for we ought to obey him that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible before thoſe whom our Eyes ſee. And it was never known nor heard of among the Children of Men, that thoſe did exerciſe Authority whom none of their Subjects ever ſaw. God is a Spirit, and is manifeſted unto and in our Spirits, and he is alſo evident to the outward Eye; for this ſees the things which his Hands hath made. Our ſelves do inhabit in and diſcern the Temple wherein alſo he dwells, and which he fills with his Preſence. <hi>Heaven is his Throne, and the Earth is his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool:</hi> So that we have as great Aſſurance that the Lord is King, as that there are Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours over ſuch particular Nations, or as a Son is aſſured that he had a Father, or a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that he hath a Maſter: And there ſhould ariſe the ſame continued Obligation of Duty towards our God, as is actually given to thoſe earthly Relations, according to what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee lift I up mine Eyes, O thou that dwelleſt in the Heavens. Behold, as the Servants look unto the Hand of their Maſters, and as the Eyes of a Maiden unto the Hand of her Mistreſs: So our Eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have Mercy upon us,</hi> Pſal. 123. 1, 2. <hi>A Son</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102492:15"/> 
                  <hi>honoureth his Father, and a Servant his Maſter: If then I be a Father, where is mine Honour, and if I be a Maſter, where is my Fear, ſaith the Lord of Hosts?</hi> Mal. 1. 6. which is the moſt reaſonable and natural thing in the World; <hi>for in him we live, and move, and have our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as certain alſo of your own Poets have ſaid, for we are alſo his Offspring:</hi> For as much then as we are the Offspring of God, we ought in all Times and in all Places to give all Honour and Obedience unto him. And ſo according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ſhould, if we had the Knowledge, and did not forget God that formed us, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in wrong Prejudices and falſe Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his ſupreme and moſt excellent Being. Our Ignorance, Corruption, and Satan's Temptation make us turn aſide, and then ſome ſtrange Imaginations make us unwilling to return. All which might be diſcovered to be Falſhood, Miſtake, and Error ſo ſoon as they are fully known.</p>
               <p>Where God calls unto the Children of Men, they ſtruggle and give backwards, and are not willing to come, and this is the <hi>Strivings of the People.</hi> This Manner of Speech is not intended of Heathens, and ſuch as have not known nor heard of God (for they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed afterwards) but it is meant of thoſe who go under the Name of <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whom he vouchſafes to ſtile his own People. Theſe have ſome Faith and Knowledge, but it is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102492:16"/> dark and imperfect; they conceive ſomewhat of God, but it is Error and Falſhood; they apprehend ſomewhat of his Law, but not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and thence comes to be in them an evil Heart of ſtanding off from God. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deceivableneſs of Heart which keeps them off (for there is a Thouſand Kind of little Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which may be anſwered in like manner) is here reduced unto theſe Three Particulars.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. They think, that themſelves are as it were forced unto Obedience, and they do not love to be compelled againſt their Will.</item>
                  <item>2. Some imagine that they have ſo grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended God that they dare not to come.</item>
                  <item>3. Which is the principal Reaſon of all, the Generality of People think, that if they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit preſently unto the Obedience of God, they ſhall be Loſers, and diſappointed of ſo much Pleaſure, Profit, and Conveniency in the mean while: They ſhall miſs of ſo much ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined Happineſs, and fall into Sowerneſs and Miſery.</item>
               </list>
               <p>If theſe Three Points can be cleared, and the Heart of Man throughly ſatisfied as to each of them, then it is juſt and equal that he ſhould not defer one Moment longer, but turn immediately unto the Lord their God.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Here that Propoſition is at Large diſcuſſed, That People are not forced and compelled to the Obedience of God, but they are left herein to their own free Choice or Refuſal.</head>
               <p>FOR the firſt, Cannot they imagine, That if it was the Mind of God, that any ſhould be compelled to his Service, could not he have brought the whole World unto his Obedience before this Time, when they have continued for ſome Thouſands of Years in their Iniquity and Tranſgreſſion? He, who <hi>faſhioneth their Hearts alike,</hi> Pſal. 33. 15. <hi>and knoweth our Frame,</hi> Pſal. 103. 14. could alſo have put into us the ſame inſtant Neceſſity and Inclination to his Worſhip and Service, as to our Meat and Drink, that without it we ſhould grow faint and periſh. He could have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the Powers of Soul only one Way, as in Brutes, and have moved them towards his Law and Will, as they are carried by Inſtinct to natural and ſenſible things; he could have implanted into every one that ſtrong Deſire of following the thing that good is, as after Life and Breath; and they ſhould abhor and flee from Evil with the like Care and Earneſtneſs as from Death and Deſtruction. He could have ſo hedged up all our Ways, that it were not poſſible to go from him, if we were never ſo eagerly bent on Backſliding, no more than
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102492:17"/> we can now get out of a ſtrong Priſon. He might have ſo compaſſed us in of every Side, that we could not avoid fulfilling his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, no more than any one doth now eſcape from under a Guard. Neither can we hide from him who is every where and in all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He might give us as ſenſible Evidence of his taking Knowledge of all our Ways, as a King doth of any Treaſon committed in his Preſence, for which we ſhould incur his ſevere Wrath immediately. <hi>Verily thou art art a God that hideſt thy ſelf, O God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the Saviour,</hi> Iſa. 45. 15. and ſo haſt done ever ſince the World began, to ſee what the Children of Men will do. God hath diſcovered himſelf no more than what was neceſſary for to exerciſe our Faith and Trial. He hath juſt made known his Name and Power amongſt Men; but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is left unto them how they will carry themſelves towards <hi>the Lord, their Strength and Redeemer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a wonderful thing to conſider, how the God who made and filleth, and is all things, ſhould yet be ſo little manifeſted unto Men! That he who is all <hi>Brightneſs</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> ſhould not be ſeen among us. That he who made and faſhioned us, in whom we live and move and have our Being, ſhould not be perceived by us: That when he filleth Heaven and Earth with his Preſence, yet any ſhould live without God in the World. <hi>Surely Darkneſs hath covered the Earth, and groſs Darkneſs the People.</hi> The Sun
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102492:17"/> gives Light upon it by Day, and the Moon by Night, and yet there is a greater Darkneſs round about which the dull Element perceives not, there is yet a worſe and greater <hi>Obſcurity</hi> in thoſe who ſee and walk therein. Strange! that it ſhould not be yet univerſally fulfilled in all People. <hi>At that Day ſhall a Man look to his Maker, and his Eyes ſhall have Respect unto the holy One of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 17. 7. for he might ſee him with the <hi>Eyes of his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,</hi> all one as he doth with his bodily Eye, ſee the Works of God, and the Earth which we tread on. By the Air which a Man breaths and moves in, he might have a Senſe and Reſemblance of him who is <hi>inviſible;</hi> who doth alſo <hi>beſet him behind and before,</hi> and is with him in his going out and coming in, and is acquainted with all his Ways. There is no going from his Spirit and Preſence. <hi>If I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend up into Heaven, thou art there: If I make my Bed in Hell, behold, thou art there: If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Parts of the Sea, even there ſhall thy Hand lead me, and thy Right Hand ſhall hold me,</hi> Pſal. 139. 8, 9, 10. And ſo he doth equally in the narrow Places of our Abode. Whether we be on a Journey, or a walking in our Chamber, or in the lower Parts of our Houſe, whether we be alone or in Company, God is all along preſent with us, but through Imperfection the Soul is not well intent on ſeveral things together, and his Creatures too often make us forget the
<pb facs="tcp:102492:18"/> Creator. As we behold them, we are unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of him that is inviſible; their Talk and Diſcourſe too often make us not think of his Word and Law. Nevertheleſs, theſe Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings might be rectified, and we might have a continual Senſe of him and of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that we might not fall nor offend. But here it is to be admired, that when there are ſo many things to bring to the knowledge and Remembrance of our God, yet Mankind for ſeveral Generations, ſhould be ſo ſottiſhly ignorant and unmindful of him. Every thing we ſee, taſte, and handle, is his Work and Creature, which ſhould renew the Senſe of the Creator; yet all theſe are made an Occaſion to forget him, the leaſt conceiving or inward reaſoning would inſtantly have led up to the Apprehenſion of him. That it muſt be ſome one who made all theſe things; for even as to the Houſes which we inhabit, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that ſome one did build them, though it was before we were born: And ſo this great Houſe of the World muſt needs have been framed by him who built all things; and he that built all things is God. <hi>Through Faith we underſtand that the Worlds were framed by the Word of God, ſo that things which are ſeen, were not made of things which do appear,</hi> Heb. 11. 3. The Heavens continue ſtanding as they were from the Days of the Creation, yet that once was, and muſt needs have been. But then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the very Continuance and upholding of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102492:18"/> the things created, doth moſt plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this <hi>eternal Power and Godhead.</hi> For <hi>I lift up my Hand to Heaven and ſay, I live for ever,</hi> Deut. 32. 40. This may be clearly ſeen, for the vaſt Roof of the Sky is kept up without any mighty Beams or Pillars. <hi>He ſtretcheth forth the North over the empty Place, and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Earth upon nothing;</hi> but then it abides only by his Support. He upholds all things by the Word of his Power. He forms and gives Life and Breath to the ſeveral things therein. They are born, move a little between, and then they die one after another. Hereby, giving us to ſignifie that himſelf alone is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and immortal, without Beginning or any Ending. They increaſe, fade, and decay, which is a manifeſt Token of Difference from his own infinite Perfection, Fullneſs, and Unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs. They are divided and ſeparated from one another, which again diſtinguiſhes from him who is all in all, whoſe <hi>Spirit filleth the World.</hi> They are very little and ſmall, which is another Diverſity from his infinite Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They are contemptible and weak, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to him alone belongs all Honour, Glory, Power and Strength: He hath ſhewed himſelf to be the Lord and a jealous God, by the very Frame of things, which have been as it were of ſet Purpoſe ſo contrived, that they ſhould not draw off the leaſt Glory, Excellency, and Admiration from the great Creator and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Majeſty of Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:102492:19"/>
               <p>How all theſe have been abuſed and ſtifled by the moſt deteſtable Ignorance and Folly, by the utmoſt Malice and Perverſeneſs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and by the manifold Devices of Satan, and by ſundry other Ways, will be one Day particularly diſcloſed, when all things ſhall be reckoned up in order as they have been done and tranſacted in this Earth. Things have been turned and perverted juſt contrary to what they were firſt intended. O ſtrange Sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs and Blindneſs! O wicked Folly! There is a Rehearſal of it throughout the Thirty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy;</hi> and the Reaſon of all may be ſomewhat underſtood from the Twentieth Verſe, <hi>And he ſaid I will hide my Face from them, I will ſee what their End ſhall be, for they are a very froward Generation, Children in whom is no Faith.</hi> If God did not hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or if they had but Faith ſtill to apprehend him, it is impoſſible that Mankind ſhould be ſo unmindful or negligent of the things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him.</p>
               <p>For they who are thankful for common Mercies and daily Benefits, and catch at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little thing; if theſe did clearly apprehend how all things are God's, and themſelves have from him whatever they enjoy, they would alſo give the ſame continual Thanks unto him, and having this Earneſt and Pledge, they would ſeek diligently after the great things of God. Who admire at every little Novelty, they would much more be aſtoniſhed at the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102492:19"/> Wonders of his Majeſty. Who are ſo careful to pleaſe their Superiours according to the Fleſh, leaſt they ſhould receive Injury or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and alſo they are ſincere and loving towards them, if they receive Good and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits from them; theſe ſame People would be alike obedient and fearful to diſpleaſe the Lord their Maker, unto whom the Inhabitants of the Earth are but as Graſhoppers, or a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of creeping Worms. If we were made alike throughly ſenſible that as God doth good, ſo he can puniſh more than one Man doth to another, there would be the like Reverence and Awe unto him. It is certain that he doth give us already whatever we enjoy, and is not that which we have conſtantly; even from our Youth up, more than thoſe little Additions of Kindneſs we have now and then from another, and conſequently ſuch do require greater Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Love. And then what he is further pleaſed to promiſe, doth not that infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whatever can be thought of, or named, or ceed had here: May we not wiſely and with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage renounce what now might be had, if it doth hinder from the Hope and Expectation of that, as that ſame Word (which makes known the great Salvation, and the Means how to obtain it) doth expreſly declare. One might run over many Particulars which would manifeſtly ſhew, That if the things of God were really believed and conſidered of, there would be the ſame, yea, more earneſt Care
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102492:20"/> and Labour after them, than after the things of this Earth. And we ſhould perform our Duty to him in all things which he requires of us, as we give Honour and do Offices one to another.</p>
               <p>But this hidden Myſtery of the Kingdom of God, and of the Divine Diſpenſation, hath puzzled the Underſtandings and Actings of Men. Indeed Man hath a confuſed apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of things, but he knows little diſtinctly, and acts yet worſe towards his Maker. Either he doth not know, or not believe, or he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, and imperfect as to both. Or when he knows the hindrances, he wilfully gives way, and is kept off by them; and when he ſees the Temptations, he doth yield unto them; or an unſeen Enemy fills him with imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and excuſes, and a <hi>deceived heart hath turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him aſide,</hi> Iſa. 44. 20. We ſhould be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careful about our Underſtanding, to have it informed with true and right Thoughts. If we may rightly apprehend the Diſpenſation of God's Kingdom, and the Nature of things before us, which pertain to us. It is called the Myſtery of the Kingdom; and therefore we ſhould Pray for the Spirit to ſearch and unfold it, to get it throughly known and revealed. If we may uſe ſuch a familiar compariſon, that as by the like Arts and Policy Men get a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Kingdom, Preferment and Riches; ſo we might endeavour after thoſe things above. Which is done by Knowledge, Induſtry, and a reſolute putting forth. The firſt inſtructs in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102492:20"/> the right way, the others ſet a going and moving forwards. We ſhould firſt Pray, and ſeek unto God, <hi>That he would lead us forth by the right way, that we may go to the City of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,</hi> Pſal. 107. 7. and ſo in all our Works and Labor in order thereto. And then it may be obſerved how things are eſtabliſhed, and alſo to be had upon foregoing means. Here it behoves to learn diligently, and to know exactly what are the true and right means; for want of which ſo many do miſcarry in their Deſigns and Enterpriſes, as our ſelves do perceive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; which if throughly known before, the thing might have been accompliſhed. And alſo we muſt underſtand what means are Juſt, or not, lawful or unlawful; for we are to confine our ſelves only unto the firſt, and avoid the other. <hi>For I the Lord love Judgment, I hate Robbery for Burnt-offering, and I will direct their work in Truth,</hi> Iſa. 61. 8. <hi>His work is perfect, for all his ways are Judgment; a God of Truth, and without Iniquity; juſt and right is he,</hi> Deut. 32. 4. And therefore we are to refrain from all manner of ſin, nor to uſe any indirect Art or Guile: But if any ſuch is offered or ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, it is to be looked upon as a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Satan, to hinder or delay the Work, and to make us part with our Integrity. There is near the ſame Connexion and Eſtabliſhment of all things throughout the whole Creation; and as we ſee the good things of the Earth are had by Wiſdom, honeſt Labour and Diligence.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102492:21"/> So we are to have Grace and Knowledge that we may obtain the heavenly good things, and ſo ſeek diligently after them. The Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth Violence, and the violent take it by force. <hi>Only he who now letteth, will let, untill he be taken out of the Way,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 7. And as he hinders all that he can, ſo we ſhould watchfully obſerve his Devices in order to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and defeat them. When we have fully heard what promotes and helps us forward to eternal Happineſs; this we are to do with all our Might and Power, and alſo we ſhould decline what hinders, or reſolutely work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that: Even from the Reſiſtances of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, we may get Strength and advance further. It may be ſo over-ruled and ordered, that the Light which he would ſeek to put out, may ſhine yet more abroad; that the Truth which he would ſtifle or wrap up may be yet more diſplayed; that all his Devices may fall back upon himſelf, and he may loſe by what he thought would promote his Kingdom. <hi>So they ſhall make their own Tongue to fall upon themſelves, all that ſee them ſhall flee away,</hi> Pſal. 64. 8. for it would be a ſtrange and marvellous thing, that if People were fully ſenſible that ſuch an in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemy (who acts by viſible Inſtruments) would deprive and hinder them of ſo much good, and deceive into Evil and Miſery, and yet they ſhould give way unto him. Is there an Inſtance of this to be found in common Life? That Men ſhould hate their Friends and love
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102492:21"/> their Enemies; eſpecially when the laſt appear barefaced as ſuch. Indeed when there is Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, Flattery, and concealing, it may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Manner, but it cannot ſo be when they openly deſign nothing but Death and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to defeat them of ſuch an exceeding Good and Reward. And yet ſuch are all the Methods of Satan, of whatever Nature and Kind they be; whether direct Oppoſition or keeping back, whether it be by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe or Imagination, as indeed all Excuſes might at firſt be ſuſpected by Chriſtian Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and diſcerning; becauſe we are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned in the Word of God, that they keep off from coming unto him, and into the Way of his Commandments. <hi>Thoſe invited to the great Supper, did all, with one Conſent, begin to make Excuſe,</hi> Luke 14. 18. Now it is plain and obvious, and underſtood by any one that where People ſhift, and would excuſe themſelves, there is an Unwillingneſs. But the Phraſe of the obedient Servant is, <hi>I will run the Way of thy Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 114. 32. which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes Readineſs and Speed in the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral Actions and Paſſages of our Life do either lead towards Heaven, they are a ſtanding ſtill, or a going backwards. They either increaſe our Reward, or they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards it, or they render us liable to Puniſhment. Now the ſtanding ſtill and doing nothing, ſinks down to the place of unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Servants; for it is contrary to the Will
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102492:22"/> of our Maſter, who would have us to be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his uſe. He ſeems to be gone afar off, that he may require an Account, though even now he ſtandeth at the door, and is near to every one of us. He hath withdrawn himſelf out of our ſight, and yet he beholds what we do, though we do not ſo much regard him; becauſe we ſee him not. In all things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God it is left to us whether we will freely and willingly do the ſame, or leave them undone.</p>
               <p>The Law given us was ordered to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a Book; and now it may be ſeen whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men will take notice, and do thereafter. As for that Law engraven in the Heart, it may be either ſtifled through Sloth or Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or it may be cheriſhed and furthered by giving heed thereunto, and acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and ſeeking further into it. God might have put into Man as ſtrong an inclination to Read in his Book, as he hath a Natural Deſire to behold the Light of the Sun, and the ſame conſtant ſteadineſs to obſerve the Words of his Law, as to Eat, Drink, and Sleep, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the common Rules and Meaſures of Life. He might have given ſuch a lively Senſe of his Promiſes and Threatnings, as any King now doth of his Rewards and Puniſhments; ſo that all People ſhould have been equally, yea infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more concerned to have the one and eſchew the other. He might have ſo inculcated and enforced his Commands, that they ſhould
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102492:22"/> be had in continual remembrance; and there ſhould have been the like conſtant Care and Caution to keep them, as to preſerve our ſelves in Health, and as we avoid bodily. Hurt or Sickneſs. The like watchfulneſs might have been in all, as is now in ſome peculiar People. Even the Multitude and Generality might be led with the ſame bent and inclination, to live always according to his Statutes, as now they have to follow their own ways. <hi>His Laws are ſet before us by his Servants the Prophets,</hi> Dan. 9. 10. And in the phraſe of another, who ſpake by the ſame Divine Spirit, <hi>Whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,</hi> Ezek. 2. 5. which denotes liberty and freedom of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Refuſal. As God did formerly ſuffer all Nations to walk in their own ways, ſo now having made known his Mind and Will, they are further proved whether they will receive the knowledge of it, and do thereafter. He hath diſcovered himſelf ſo far to the World by what is already revealed and made known, that they ſhould ſeek after him yet further. His Truth is thus far manifeſt to the generality of Mankind, that they alſo ſhould learn and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after it. <hi>That the reſidue of Men might ſeek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom my Name is called, ſaith the Lord, who doth all theſe things,</hi> Acts 15. 17. Still there muſt be ſome act and endeavour in Man. There muſt be both a willingneſs and compliance in him to accept of what God hath done for him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102492:23"/> hereunto is the whole Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that form of Speech our Saviour makes uſe of in reference to himſelf and his Diſciples, <hi>He that receiveth you receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me,</hi> Mat. 10. 40. <hi>And he that deſpiſeth you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth me,</hi> Luke 10. 10. The one is a willing Act, and the other a wilful Refuſal. So his Servant <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh unto the World, <hi>He which is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill; and he that is Righteous, let him be Righteous ſtill,</hi> Rev. 22. 11. Not that it is the Mind of God that any one ſhould continue in his wickedneſs; for he hath no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, but rather that he turn and live. But after former Calls there comes this kind of Speech, That ſuch an one may chooſe; he may do what he will, for God ſeems to caſt him off; and this makes People the more willing to come, as we have an Example hereof in <hi>Judges</hi> 10. 13, 14, 15. As on the other hand when things are prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and ſeem to be made eaſie, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn it, and do keep off.</p>
               <p>The whole Hiſtory of the Church ever ſince the World began, and alſo the Method of his Spiritual Diſpenſation doth plainly ſhew that all Men are left to their free Liberty and Choice whether they will ſerve God or not: <hi>And if it ſeem Evil unto you to ſerve the Lord, chooſe you this day whom you will ſerve; whether the Gods which your Fathers ſerved: but as for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord,</hi> Joſhua
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102492:23"/> 24. 15. <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt not thou be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? and if thou doſt not well, ſin lieth at the door,</hi> Gen. 4. 7.</p>
               <p>Truly God is the great King over all the Earth, and he hath Right to Rule over all its Inhabitants. He is the Lord and Governour of the World; and it is meet that he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Authority, and receive Homage from all things which he hath made: How much more from ſuch a ſmall ſpot, and little part of his Creation, as the Earth is? Every one who doth in the leaſt conſider, muſt acknowledge God's Dominion moſt juſt and due in the general; for our ſelves aſſent unto that Honour and Obedience which are given to thoſe ſeveral Relations of King, Father and Maſter: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thoſe according to the fleſh, and our own Fellow-Creatures, are not ſo much in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the high and lofty One, as a ſingle duſt of the Ballance is to the whole Fabrick of the World; or as a drop of a Bucket to the Sea, or as a ſingle Graſhopper is to all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that have Life and Breath: So there ſhould not be the leaſt grudging at his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority and Regining over us. And as our ſelves like to have things done readily and chearfully, ſo likewiſe it is reaſonable that God ſhould expect the ſame of us. <hi>Thy People ſhall be willing in the day of thy Power,</hi> Pſal. 110. 3. God is the ſame from all Eternity, and hath at all times the very ſame Power; for he can do all things, and whatſoever he pleaſes. But
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102492:24"/> as it is ſaid in another place, <hi>Many a time turned he his Anger away, and did not ſtir up all his Wrath,</hi> Pſal. 78. 38. So likewiſe he hath not yet in this Earth, nor doth now exert all his Power and Might. Indeed ſometimes he doth make a little more then ordinary manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, as in thoſe Signs and Wonders which he wrought of Old Time; and then we hear what effect they had; for they did cauſe an impreſſion upon the Minds of People; and they were for the time Reverent, Submiſſive, and Obedient towards God. He might have continued the like tokens among them, and have given them a ſucceſſion of more, which alſo ſhould have ſpoken as ſenſibly unto them as out of the Cloudy Pillar, <hi>That it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they kept not his Laws which he gave them.</hi> Theſe things were done once or twice in the ſeveral Generations that paſſed through here; not to every Generation, but to thoſe in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time, that they might tell their Children to come, to ſee if they would be perſwaded to keep his Statutes, and obſerve his Laws by what they heard God viſibly did amongſt their Forefathers. Thoſe Miracles, were ſoon over, and did not remain long among them: To prove whether the Remembrance would have the like effect, as when they were preſent and before the Faces of People. Who were over-aw'd by the ſight of ſuch dreadful Things, might ſtill call to mind the ſame, and perform a free and ready Service. And ſo as they did look
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102492:24"/> back, and had heard of the things done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; ſo we now living may likewiſe reflect on the ſame. And we who now ſtand in theſe latter days on the Earth, may look forward to what may be in our time, and in the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions following.</p>
               <p>When God ſhall yet in a more extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner than ſince the beginning of the World, or Man was Created on the Earth, Bow the Heavens and come down, declare his Power and Preſence in a much more viſible and eminent manner than ever of old time; when the Lord God ſhall dwell amongſt us, and Reign before his Ancients Gloriouſly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who would not fear and obey thee, O King of Nations?</hi> foraſmuch as thou containeſt all the good and excellency which is any where to be found amongſt the beſt and wiſeſt of the Sons of Men. For thou firſt gaveſt unto them what is now loved and honoured in them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more Reverence, and Love, and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and good Will belong unto thee, of whom are all things. Thou didſt therefore communicate a light and imperfect meaſure of Good unto the beſt of Men; leſt they ſhould draw off from looking on thee, who art All in all.</p>
               <p>When God himſelf ſhall come and appear, even the Rebellious alſo ſhall ſubmit unto him; for they ſhall be over-awed with his Majeſty and Greatneſs; and they ſhall be likewiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded thereunto by his Goodneſs and Truth.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102492:25"/> 
                  <hi>The deſire of all Nations ſhall come,</hi> and he ſhall ſo clearly manifeſt himſelf to be indeed what he hath revealed himſelf, Loving unto every Man; He doth good, and filleth our Souls with Food and Gladneſs: when this is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, then all former Prejudices and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation againſt him ſhall vaniſh, and be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly done away. In that day ſhall this Song be Sung by his Elect and peculiar People, <hi>This is the Lord whom we have waited for;</hi> and others ſhall be aſtoniſhed and confounded within themſelves, how it came to paſs that they ſhould either deſpiſe or conceive evil Thoughts againſt him. They ſhall bite their Tongues for Indignation, which did utter hard Speeches againſt his Majeſty. <hi>The Lord and his Saints ſhall convince them of their ungodly deeds,</hi> Jude 15. and they ſhall be ſo vexed within themſelves, that they would even of their own accord cut off both their Hands and their Feet which did offend, and were inſtrumental to commit Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and caſt them into the fire. <hi>Truly, God is good to Iſrael, even to ſuch as are of a clean heart,</hi> Pſal. 73. 1. He ſhall more plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate himſelf to be thus, than that the Sun doth now give Light to the lower World, or that he gives Rain which wets and moiſtens the Earth. He ſhall ſenſibly manifeſt himſelf to be agreeable unto our Nature. He is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto, and ſhall moſt fully ſatisfie eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Deſire in the Soul of Man. Stretch out your Underſtanding every way conceive to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102492:25"/> utmoſt, more than is poſſible to utter; whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you want or would have, our God ſhall be yet more unto us.</p>
               <p>This was ſomewhat diſcerned before by thoſe who were of a <hi>pure Heart.</hi> They had a little Taſte and foreconception of his Goodneſs. The more they did ſearch into it, the more they did find and were ſatisfied therein. But the Generality of Mankind were willingly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of this. They did not like to receive God into their Knowledge, nor ſeek after and underſtand his Nature and Properties. Thence came to be in them an evil Heart of Forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Averſation towards him, for they could not be unmindful, nor yet have any Eſtrangedneſs, had they known him. How is it poſſible to forget him who created all things, and is all in all, who filleth Heaven and Earth with his Preſence? How can any one refuſe the deſiring of him who is the chief and only Good: From whom is derived all that is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profitable and truly ſweet unto us? Who even now is kind, and poureth down his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits upon us, but hath reſerved for us greater and more enduring things. The things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent do juſtly require our Praiſe and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment; but the things to come do call for our Obedience and Duty. We ſhould even now ſpeak out of what we have, and do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for God, in Expectation of what we ſhall be Partakers. That we ſhould ſhew forth the utmoſt Good-will towards him now we are in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102492:26"/> the Way, and he hath put us in a Capacity to do it. We may by Faith apprehend, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt in what he promiſes, ſo it is our Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and will be our Advantage to give all Readineſs to perform what he doth require of us. <hi>Wherefore Beloved, ſeeing that ye look for ſuch things, be diligent that ye may be found of him without Spot and blameleſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 14. Such Wages and Reward are ſufficient to put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doing every Tittle of our Duty, to cleanſe our ſelves that we may be meet Partakers, and when we have done all, we come ſhort; for our Services are in no wiſe proportionable to the expected Recompence. Not the Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth Part thereof could have been thought of and expected, unleſs God had been pleaſed to make known and promiſe it; and ſtill we are to wait what he of his own good Pleaſure will do for his Creatures.</p>
               <p>There are many Conſiderations, which alſo ſhould make us <hi>willing</hi> in the Day of his Grace and Forbearance, as we ſhall certainly be in the <hi>Day of his Power.</hi> If we would now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what we ſhall then be ſenſible of, we ſhould even at this preſent Time do after the required Manner, for the very ſame Reaſons, as we ſhall then wiſh we had done it. What pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails upon his own peculiar People to do ſuch and ſuch things, would do the ſame as to others, for they alſo are Men of the ſame Paſſions and Inclinations, but theſe were governed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the Knowledge and Grace of our
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102492:26"/> Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Even we ſhould move and preſs earneſtly to the Mark of the high Calling, if we would further receive and attend unto what would quicken us from within. <hi>Paul</hi> did labour more abundantly than the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, becauſe of the greater Degree of Grace which was in him, Grace is an active Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſtirs up to be continually doing the Will of God. Yea, there is the like Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards the ſame in the Soul, as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath after Meat and Drink. <hi>Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled,</hi> Mat. 5. 6. When there is the ſame earneſt Appetite after all the things of God, expreſſed by that one Word of <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> as others have after the Increaſe and full Enjoyment of their Corn and Wine, here is an aſſured Promiſe of obtaining and of full Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Now an earneſt Deſire (unleſs it be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Sloth or Negligence) puts upon Action, and uſing the Means to obtain; for in Deſire there is Torment, and we muſt do ſomething to be freed from that, or elſe ſeek to quiet and ſtupifie it. Again, This ſame Deſire common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly points out and ſhews ſome future and diſtant Good, which may be had upon ſuch things to be done before; and alſo there is a Want in the Soul of the ſame thing, which is ſuitable unto her Nature. We were therefore put in an imperfect Condition, that we might aſcend up and labour after what is further ſet before
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102492:27"/> us. There is ſuch a Senſe and Conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this in Mankind, that they do actually endeavour to embetter their preſent Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on where there is any Probability and Likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and where they do not, it is through wretched Sloth or dull Ignorance. In this the rational Creatures differ from brute Beaſts; for theſe only live to eat and labour: They juſt breath and are not ſenſible of more. Whereas Man acts after, and can conceive things more excellent. Now if there be the like Aſſurance and Certainty to obtain them as the things before us, then it is a reaſonable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, That there ſhould be a like and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Endeavour, becauſe of their infinitely more Worth and longer Continuance. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt worldly Good doth not ſatisfie when had, and of this we muſt be certainly deprived in a ſhort Time; whereas the heavenly good things are proportionable to our utmoſt Deſires, and ſhall for ever remain. So that, was there but a doubtful Expectation of ſuch great and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during things (a Probability that they were, and a Poſſibility that they were not) yet one might give up, and leave theſe preſent things upon the alone Venture (if we may ſo ſpeak) of thoſe things to come. Whatever doth now pertain to us, and is had by us, doth utterly periſh and come to nothing. They are all along paſſing by, and at length Man dies and is taken away from them. So the things of this World are no Foundation, for it ſlides
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102492:27"/> away, and alſo our ſelves are decaying. Now if there was no more, how come in thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after continuing and durable things? When we ſee every thing paſſeth away, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do we even now covet after what remains? When our ſelves are continually dying, why do we thirſt after Immortality? And ſince we do, Day by Day, haſte to that State where we ſeem to ceaſe to be, what means that earneſt Inclination to have a Being for ever? There is a ſtrong Perſwaſion and aſſured Confidence that we ſhall not die, or rather, <hi>Thy dead Men ſhall live, together with my dead Body ſhall they ariſe,</hi> Iſa. 26. 19. But we ſhall only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into another Place, or ſtand here again in theſe later Days upon the Earth, when both our ſelves and this Place alſo ſhall be changed into a more glorious and abiding Condition. That very Knowledge and Deſire implanted into our Nature, of more than is perceived or can be had here, doth moſt clearly demonſtrate that there are real things to which it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. It being ſo firmly riveted and grafted in, doth plainly ſhew that it came from the Author of our Nature: Even he who made us, hath ſo ordained us; who created the Fleſh, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo form the Spirit. And as that is eſtabliſhed to have a Senſe of things ſenſible, ſo this hath a Knowledge and Conception of things ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. As that taſtes and ſees the things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſo the Soul doth as evidently perceive and apprehend things to come. And this would
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102492:28"/> equally appear in all People, if they did in like manner put forth the Powers of their Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards divine and heavenly things, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and Members of Body are employed about the things of the Earth. <hi>Then ſhall we know if we follow on to know the Lord,</hi> Hoſ. 6. 3. Firſt know ſomewhat of his infinite and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Godhead, and then how he hath created and eſtabliſhed things. Alſo in our ſelves is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted a Power and Capacity to arrive at the Knowledge of them.</p>
               <p>It is ſuperfluous to bring many Arguments to prove the things which are true and real al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; but yet becauſe they are concealed and hidden, by ſearching they may be found out: when the Evidence of things not ſeen is brought forth, it makes as if they were ſeen. So we find in ordinary Caſes, that in a matter of Fact done heretofore, or in a diſtant Place, it is as nothing to us; but when it is declared and told unto us by certain faithful Witneſſes, it is in a manner preſent, and as if we ſaw it with our Eyes. Thus it is of hiſtorical Matters and common things done in the World: So it is likewiſe of God's wonderful Acts done in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Generations, the Miracles and Signs wrought by Chriſt and his Apoſtles which are conveyed down unto us a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>er the ſame manner, as publick Records, which are either written, or one Generation tells to another. Now the firſt is the more certain Way, becauſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains when the Voice and Sound of the Mouth periſhes in the Utterance, and many times is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102492:28"/> forgotten. There is the expreſs Order of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 8. that theſe things be <hi>written.</hi> Hence his Word is called Scripture, that is, a Writing, and is ſo <hi>noted in a Book, that it may be for the Time to come for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which is a Declaration of God's Will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Men, what he doth require of them, with a Rehearſal and Promiſes of what he hath already, and will yet do for them. Our ſelves know what we intend to do ſuch a Time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if we have Life, Power, the ſame Mind and Circumſtances continue alike. Now he is the Everliving Almighty God, with whom is no Shadow of turning; who ſits above, and hath the Diſpoſal of all Times and Seaſons; who governs and hath Power over all things; who knows all the Hearts of all the Sons of Men, the utmoſt which is or can be: Before whom all things, paſt, preſent, and to come, are the ſame. So what he hath ſaid, ſhall moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be. <hi>For the Lord of Hosts hath purpoſed, and who ſhall diſannul it,</hi> Iſa. 14. 27. <hi>I will work and who ſhall let it?</hi> Iſa. 43. 13. However, for a while Satan and his Inſtruments are ſuffered to reſiſt and to try what they can to hinder, yet the Work of God cannot be utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; for notwithſtanding all the Malice and Oppoſition of Men or Devils, it will come to paſs at the laſt. Hath he ſaid, and ſhall it not come to paſs? Yes aſſuredly; <hi>For that that is determined ſhall be done,</hi> Dan. 11. 36. <hi>For the Viſion is yet, for an appointed Time, but at the End it ſhall ſpeak and not lie: Though it</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:102492:29"/> 
                  <hi>tarry, wait for it; becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry,</hi> Hab. 2. 3. But in the mean while we are apt to ſtagger and diſtruſt, becauſe we do not ſee it fulfilled in our Generations. Whereas we are but of a ſhort Time, and to him a Thouſand Years are but as one Day, and he will have a ſuitable Space for fulfilling his great and glorious Work. For even the leſſer things are done gradually and in Succeſſion of Time. In this little Space and ſhort Time, we do not find all things to be ſo as we are told of; yet nevertheleſs we are here ſo much aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the leſs, as to build up a ſure Truſt and Confidence for the greater. And we ſhall be tranſlated up thither, where it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>As we have heard, ſo have we ſeen,</hi> Pſal. 48. 8. when Faith ſhall be turned into Viſion; the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of things not ſeen ſhall be the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance how our God did promiſe and keep them out of Sight. But now he doth perform the ſame, and they are revealed with open Face. Therefore were they ordered to be fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and unſeen, to prove whether we would give Credence unto his Word: If we would be diligent in the Work of the Lord, expecting a Reward from him in his due Time. But if his great and good things were now preſent before us, and to be had as thoſe things of this World now are, what ſnatching and running would there be after them? People would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think themſelves too diligent and earneſt. They would make haſte and not delay the Time
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102492:29"/> to keep God's Commandments. Had they a through and firm Perſwaſion of what he ſaith, <hi>Every Man ſhall receive his own Reward accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own Labour,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 8. Each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would then try who ſhall moſt abound in the Work of the Lord. They would lay hold of every Opportunity for well-doing, if they might partake of his Acceptation and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. They would call to mind what they had been heretofore a doing. To what End or to what Good were all the paſt Actions they had taken under the Sun? What am I at preſent better for having had or done this? And is there Expectation of any thing more? Will my heretofore ſerving divers Luſts and Pleaſures make me happy now? Wherefore then do they not ſatisfie at this Moment? Why do they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vaniſh and diſappear? How comes it to paſs that Day by Day they ceaſe to delight, and are leſs recreating? Surely, I have been miſtaken all along. It is Happineſs and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which I deſire, and they make a falſe Shew thereof. It is Peace and Reſt which I would endeavour at, and they leave behind Craving and Trouble.</p>
               <p>The ſinful Profits of this World ſeem to be ſomewhat more enduring and real. But let us reflect upon them either Way, as, Soul, eat, drink and be merry. We will get ſo much and then enjoy our ſelves according as the Phraſe of the World is; or to pleaſe our ſelves with keeping an Abundance as the covetous Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102492:30"/> doth. Yet ſtill this is a meer conceit and a Reaſonable Creature cannot be filled or ſatisfied with that, and here <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 17, 18. lies expreſs againſt him, <hi>For when he dieth, he ſhall carry nothing away, his Glory ſhall not deſcend after him. Though whilſt he lived, he bleſſed his Soul.</hi> All the Service and Labour after Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is evidently determined within this ſhort Time; and it ſtands in no ſtead at all further. Now an Account ſhall be demanded what we have done here? What Proviſion was made againſt the Time to come? What Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was laid in by good Works? Wherefore was all their Labour about periſhing and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things? And not about the eternal which do remain? Every one is to give account for his Talent and how he improved it to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Maſter; that he may receive Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Commendation proportionable. It ſhall be recompenſed to every one according to what he hath done. Where was more done, there ſhall be a greater Reward: ſo that all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Man tend as much to himſelf in that State, as what is done in the preſent Time. The unprofitable Servant is to be bound Hand and Foot, and to be caſt into outer Darkneſs. Every one is called to work in the Vineyard; and if any one doth not come as ſoon as he is called (as thoſe did in the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.) himſelf muſt anſwer before Almighty God for the Refuſal to obey his Commands. And alſo People do not attend nor rightly conſider
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102492:30"/> how they willingly deprive themſelves of ſo much Wages and Recompenſe. Seeing that God hath revealed himſelf to be ſo bountiful and good a Maſter, Servants ſhould ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves accordingly unto him; and as it were, meet him in the Way of Righteouſneſs. They are to ſtrive who ſhould run faſteſt; who ſhall perform their Work with a more willing and chearful Mind; and to offer themſelves who ſhall make the firſt Aſſault, or do ſuch an Act of Duty; for even thus much is done for our Maſters according to the Fleſh. Is not God more gracious and better than they? Are not his Benefits as valuable? Ought not his Favour and Good-will to be more eſteemed?</p>
               <p>But his good things are to come; why, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we now have and enjoy, did firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from God and is his own. Man hath the Uſe of ſome things, but God hath the Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of all. But the greater things alſo will be actually preſent as thoſe things now before us are; and then theſe preſent things ſhall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly done away. So they are upon equal, yea more Advantage than what is now before our Eyes. Tribulation, Anguiſh and ſelf-Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be upon every Soul that did neglect them for periſhing Bubbles and empty No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things: Which then they find, as before they might have learned, to come to nothing at all; for they were juſt had and paſſed by. And yet by the Nature of them, by the utmoſt Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Reality of future and inviſible things
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102492:31"/> they might have been perſwaded to ſeek dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently after them.</p>
               <p>For the ſame Word of Truth, which ſpake of the one, hath told us of the other alſo. <hi>By the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made,</hi> Pſal. 33. 6. <hi>And upholding all things by the Word of his Power,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. which hath created and given to each thing its Nature; and now connects and holds things faſt together as they are The ſame Word ſaith, <hi>For behold, I create new Heavens, and a new Earth,</hi> Iſa. 65. 17. ſo that as certainly as things now are, and ſtand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner as they do at preſent, they will be likewiſe ſo fulfilled as we are foretold of. Thoſe gracious Promiſes in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 17, 18, 19. are confirmed with the like Reaſon, which is as it were inſerted between them, <hi>viz. But</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved in the Lord with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Salvation: Ye ſhall not be aſhamed, nor confounded World without End. For thus ſaith the Lord that created the Heavens; God himſelf that formed the Earth and made it; he hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed it, he created it not in vain: he formed it to be inhabited, I am the Lord and there is none elſe. I have not ſpoken in ſecret, in a dark Place of the Earth: I ſaid not unto the Seed of</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſeck ye me in vain: I the Lord ſpeak Righteouſneſs, I declare things that are right.</hi> Here is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and full Satisfaction given to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Queſtion and Thought, what do People get by the Service of God? They expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to prevent Self-denial and Labour, but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102492:31"/> what Recompence and Gain? For if others are diligent after worldly things, they do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obtain. But here we are aſſured of that which cannot be had in this World, <hi>To be ſaved with an everlaſting Salvation.</hi> There is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Return to exerciſe our Faith and Waiting. So that now we become liable to Shame and Diſappointment by labouring for nothing: Yet what ſaith the Witneſs of God? <hi>Ye ſhall not be aſhamed World without End.</hi> At long run it ſhall not be thus. At the End of Time it ſhall be otherwiſe; and this is ratified by what we now ſee, even his leſſer Works are done for ſome Purpoſe, as in the Inſtance here aſſigned, the Earth was created to be inhabited. But here again Faith is exerciſed; for ſome things ſeem to be created in vain, and a Part of the Earth is not inhabited, as barren Mountains and the waſte howling Wilderneſs; yet there are alſo Creatures of ſome Sorts, and God may have great Intents and Purpoſes herein, which we know not as yet, but ſhall know. He aſſerts himſelf by his Name, the Lord, to be AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY, the chief and only Ruler, and none can controul him; ſo that he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he hath ſaid. If one thinks within himſelf to do thus, or makes private Promiſes, there he may alter his Mind or Falſify and meet with no Diſcredit, but only from the Perſon to whom it was entruſted. But God declares out of the Thoughts of his Heart, and ſpeaks out pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to all the World, that neither the Seed of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102492:32"/> 
                  <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor any one who doth the Works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or comes within the Covenant made to the Patriarchs, ſhall <hi>ſeek him in vain.</hi> Again, He confirms it further by his righteous Nature, and declaring the things that are right. So we may be bold to ſay, that where in ſerving him we ſubmit our ſelves to preſent Loſs or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, there God is pleaſed to ſpeak in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and thence we may aſſuredly gather, that he will render a Reward accordingly. But as he is gracious and bountiful, it will as much exceed our Works, as if one ſhould give a Thouſand Pounds to a Labourer, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no more than a Penny. <hi>God is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous to forget your Work and Labour of Love,</hi> Heb. 6. 10. He will take notice of every thing that is done purely for him. <hi>Thou tellest my Wandrings, put thou my Tears into thy Bottle: Are they not in thy Book,</hi> Pſal. 56. 8. As he doth take Knowledge of every leaſt Sin and Error; ſo likewiſe will he make up abundantly to us for all the Sorrow and Hardſhip we have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained for him. <hi>A Book of Remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord and thought on his Name,</hi> Mal. 3. 16. in which is recorded all the Reproaches they endured from the wicked, and alſo every right Work they have done with all the particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereof. The Apoſtle adviſes, <hi>Look to your ſelves that we loſe not thoſe things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full Reward,</hi> 2 John 8. So the like Admonition may be given
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102492:32"/> to thoſe who are as yet unconverted and in a State of Sin, that they defer not one Moment longer to turn unto the Lord their God. For beſides the Danger of being cut off in their Sins, and the Doubtfulneſs of gaining God's Favour and Acceptation; but if they ſhould obtain, yet they deprive themſelves of a greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Though the long and habituated Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may be ſaved, that is, only when he turns from all the Sins which he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right; yet it will be as by Fire, that is with Difficulty: However, he ſhall <hi>ſuffer Loſs:</hi> That is, it would be better for him throughout all Eternity, if he had never continued in ſuch a Courſe of Sin. <hi>What Fruit had ye then in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> Rom. 6. 21. There is no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and Advantage in them. So likewiſe Time ſlides away, ſuch Opportunities are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocably loſt which might be improved to a bleſſed Eterntiy. So much might be done in the mean while towards building up a Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Heavens. The Foundation may in due time be laid; and upon this he may <hi>build Gold, Silver, precious Stones, Wood, Hay, Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> He may wiſely contrive and do the beſt Works. <hi>Every Man's Works ſhall be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, for the Day ſhall declare it,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 13. The Light ſhall ſhew of what Kind it is, and how it hath been wrought all along, even when it was in Beginning, and ſo till the Finiſhing thereof. It ſhall be ſtrictly examined and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102492:33"/> as Gold in the Fire, which purges away the Droſs, when the pure Metal remains, and appears more excellent. <hi>If any Man's Work abide which he hath built thereupon, he ſhall receive a Reward,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 14. If he hath been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about enduring things, here is another Promiſe and Confirmation hereof.</p>
               <p>What Need of ſuch abundant Mention and giving ſo full Aſſurance concerning a Reward? Why have we not a good God, who giveth us now all things richly to enjoy? May we not do ſomething for him by way of Gratitude and Thankfulneſs for former Mercies, without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of any thing more? Where is our Love and Ingenuity that we cannot act by the Principles of an excellent Nature, but muſt be led on by Mercenarineſs? Our Want and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection call for ſomething more than we have already. But then we ſhould deſire ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which is worthy. It is Narrowneſs of Spirit and Ignorance of Mind to run ſo greedily after worldly and preſent Recompence, or to imagine more therein than really is. It is baſe Selfiſhneſs to do nothing but for the Sake of Profit in Caſe we are ſomewhat ſufficient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But ſeeing that moſt have not and they muſt live by Labour; and the Bleſſing and the Promiſe is, <hi>For thou ſhalt eat the Labour of thine Hands, happy ſhalt thou be and it ſhall be well with thee,</hi> Pſal. 128. 2. there it may be honeſtly ſought after and had. In every thing there is Trial <hi>(What is Man that thou ſhouldſt try him eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:102492:33"/> 
                  <hi>Moment!)</hi> And nevertheleſs it is further ſo ordained that the Servant of God may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove himſelf therein, and yet not be in Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of falling. There are the Wages of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Unrighteouſneſs, the Gifts of Satan, which are offered and had upon unlawful Means if they will decline from the Law of the moſt High, conſent unto ſome Evil, and ſo fall down and worſhip the Author thereof: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they would keep their Integrity; continue whole and ſtedfaſt in his Covenant, God hath annexed further unto that a precious Promiſe and exceeding Reward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who hath firſt given to him and it ſhall be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced to him again? For of him, and through him, and to him are all things,</hi> Rom. 11. 35, 36. He hath firſt furniſhed us with Means, and enabled with Power to perform whatever we do. He hath given Knowledge, Strength, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and Impulſe. It is done by his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting and working Grace, and at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Requiring. If I may uſe ſuch a plain and common Phraſe, leaſt it ſhould be ſaid, God is any thing beholden to his Creatures he doth give them ſuch an overabundunt Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, even before we had done what was our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do. And what he is pleaſed to add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is infinitely-beyond our, deſerving, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could we have any Expectation thereof un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs himſelf had foretold us. By Faith Boaſting is excluded, for Faith is the Gift of God, and alſo it apprehends things unutterable and ſo
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102492:34"/> exceeding great that it is no more Vertue and Excellency to receive them, than ſtooping down to the Ground to take up a Diamond, or going half a Mile for a Bag of Gold and to have it for our Pains. The Prize ſet befors us doth yet exceed our utmoſt Endeavour after it. So that the having an Eye unto the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Reward, doth quite ſtop our Mouth and take away all manner of Boaſting. For it is evident, when ſuch exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes will ſcarce move us to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and where they do, yet not to perform it continually; much leſs ſhould we have done ſuch as is commanded if we had no Promiſes at all. Even in thoſe things which we think we need not do, as in Free-will Offerings and what we would do of our own Accord, There is a ſecret Hope and Expectation that God would take notice thereof: And a Thought doth ariſe, at leaſt a Doubt and Staggering, whether if we were aſſured that he would not requite it but yet accept and be well-pleaſed with it, then the Tryal would be whether we would ſtill do the ſame only out of Love and Thankfulneſs, admitting it would further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to preſent Inconveniences and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Our Nature is either averſe or ſluggiſh that we have need of ſomething to conquer and ſtir us up; firſt to bring us in, and then to quicken us in the right way. To move us to begin, and then to keep us continually in doing. <hi>Now to him that worketh is the Reward</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:102492:34"/> 
                  <hi>reckoned not of Grace but of Debt,</hi> Rom. 4. 4. So it is of one Man from another as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from Verſ. 2. <hi>For if</hi> Abraham <hi>be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Works, he hath whereof to glory, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</hi> If one labours for another he is not beholden to him for Wages, for the Work is as profitable and beneficial to the one as Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to the other: But the Caſe is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe between God and us; for firſt he hath wrought all our Works in us, he brought us into Being, and hath fed us up hitherto: And one Way or another he hath prevented, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and directed in thoſe things which more immediately relate unto him, though we are heedleſs as not to diſcern it, no more than we perceive how we live and move in him, which yet we do all along, that to him belongs all the Glory and Praiſe thereof. The utmoſt in Man is his Liberty of acting and working to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Grace of God; but ſtill he firſt implanted that Power and Ability; and when it turns towards Good, it was God and his Grace that weighed down the Scale, and over-ruled it unto the right and true Way.</p>
               <p>Alaſs! We are ſuch ſmall and finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that the utmoſt we do is very little and next to nothing: For if the beſt Performances of the greateſt and moſt diligent Saints on Earth be conſidered, what is their Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him? Or what receives he of their Hands? Even they come ſhort of what they might have done yet more, for they might
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102492:35"/> have further improved their Talent. <hi>Therefore I ſay unto you, the Kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you and given to a Nation bringing forth the Fruits thereof,</hi> Mat. 21. 43. But ſince the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Promulgation of the Goſpel to the World no Nation hath yet brought forth ſuch Fruits (God knows what will be done in the latter Days) as might be juſtly expected from it. Nothing hath been done anſwerable to the precious Truths contained therein. It was the Lord who gave the Word, who planted the Trees, but the Ground hath not brought forth ſuitable Increaſe thereof. The Husbandmen have not manured and dreſſed it as they ſhould have done. And what Fruits have been, or ſhall at length ſpring up from it, Lord, thou haſt but what is thine own: They are but liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtruments, all one as the Spade or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Hook in the Hands of the Gardiner; and at laſt the Work ſuffers Loſs and Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toge by Reaſon of thoſe employed therein. If they do any thing rightly, it is of God that they do ſo, but the Weakneſs and Fault is of themſelves only: God worketh in us both to will and to do: He hath ſhewed us how; ſo that all things and all our Works are to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to him only: He ſits above and Chriſt at his Right Hand, expecting what his Servants will do for him; in like manner as till his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are made his Footſtool: Both which are conſequent one to the other; for by means of his Servants he will overcome the rebellious and make them ſubmit under him.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:102492:35"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord looketh down from Heaven upon the Children of Men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand and ſeek God,</hi> Pſal. 14. 1. That did rightly apprehend the End of their Being in this World and did look after their Maker, that by the things known already did aſcend yet further. That by what is known of God, did ſeek out yet more, if they could find out further Trace and Footſteps of this inviſible Being. As his Way is in the Waters, he rideth upon the Wings of the Wind and the Clouds are the Duſt of his Feet, ſo we may ſee God in every thing. To behold him, not only in the Sanctuary, but in every Part of his Temple, which is Heaven and Earth, and in each Part and Corner thereof. To behold him in his viſible Works, and to perceive him in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things. To underſtand that great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Creator and his Creatures: But more eſpecially how we are concerned with that God with whom we have all to do. What he doth require of us, and what we are to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto him. The Phraſe of looking down to ſee doth plainly denote that they are left to their Freedom and Liberty. The ſame is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſignified in the Parable of the Vineyard, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. and <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 1, 2. where God hath done all things that were neceſſary and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and looks what will come of it: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Powers of acting he hath endued the Sons of Men withal will be employed in the right way, or in extravagant things, or be fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in Idleneſs and Sloth.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:102492:36"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Branch in me that beareth not Fruit he taketh away, and every Branch that beareth Fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more Fruit,</hi> John 15. 2. To all is committed at firſt ſome Grace and Power in order to ſpiritual things; but who do not uſe it accordingly, it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from them. But to them who manage aright is committed yet more that they ſhould labour according to the Strength given them. For whatever is in us is to be uſed and put forth. Knowledge is to be communicated, and ſtill further Degrees and Increaſe thereof is to be ſought after in order to impart that forth again. Truth is to be declared and ſpoken out, and this alſo is to be ſought after and received for the aforeſaid End and Purpoſe. As the Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom is to the Fruit, ſo is Knowledge to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and good Works. The firſt is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, it goes before and gives Hope of the Fruit which is better; and accordingly will end in that unleſs it be blaſted and withered. So this is the Beginning of our Duty; for we cannot do any thing in order to God unleſs we know ſomewhat of him. We cannot keep his Law till we apprehend what it is: As there is an Unwillingneſs, Averſation, Forgetfulneſs of God and good things; ſo there ſhould be ſomething to overcome that, to ſtir up our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, to keep this always in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of our Heart. <hi>O Lord God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>and of</hi> Iſrael <hi>our Fathers, keep this for ever in the Imagination of the Thoughts of</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:102492:36"/> 
                  <hi>the Heart of thy People, and prepare their Heart unto thee,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 18. Nevertheleſs it is too often ſeen through the marvellous Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Satan (who doth every way endeavour to beguile and to beat off) that many have good and right Knowledge, but it remains as it were blaſted, for it lies dead within and doth not ſhoot forth into well-doing. Many times it drops off and Periſhes, having no Root or Stalk in them; for taking no Delight, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending no Good therein, they ſuffer it to paſs through their Underſtanding as Water run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through a Pipe; which may wet and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten a little for the Time, but returns to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Drineſs. They may be a little affected for the Time, but afterwards they do not mind nor give heed thereafter. It makes a goodly Shew and Appearance without, but it is meer Leaf and Colour, and nothing worth unleſs it grows towards Fruit and Perfection.</p>
               <p>God is not to be ſerved by halves. As he requires the whole Man, ſo he would have his Work finiſhed and compleat, or elſe a tending towards it, if it be ſuch as he will accept of. <hi>Shew me thy Faith without thy Works, and I will ſhew thee my Faith by my Works,</hi> Jam. 2. 18. Faith may be without Works, but Works is a good Sign of Faith. If they be right ſpiritual and Divine Works, they muſt have Faith and Knowledge for Beginning and Performance of the ſame; for wouldſt thou know, wherefore they are done by ſome and not by others? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102492:37"/> ſome underſtand the Obligation they are under, and the Encouragement they have to the ſame. All People would alike do the Will of God if they have the like Thoughts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions concerning the ſame. There is one Faith and one Hope. So they might equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe and have the ſame Aſſurance of good things to come, if they would ſtudy and ſeek diligently after them. If they would ſuffer themſelves to know their Duty and be in a Readineſs to perform the ſame, God would reveal it unto them: Provided they do receive the Knowledge thereof, and not put it off and ſtifle it: He would incline them to do the ſame, if they would yield unto and not reſiſt his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He would give his Spirit if they would not grieve nor quench it; and if they would preſerve their Body in Holineſs and Sobriety, fit for its Habitation, he would enlighten and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie their Underſtandings, if they would draw off the thick Coverings of Ignorance and Diſobedience; which make that either the Mind cannot apprehend at all, or it is full of Falſhood and Deluſions: For the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors having not obſerved but departed from the Law of the moſt High, to ſave and defend themſelves, they ſeek out for Excuſes and Imaginations; and through the Perplexity and Maze of them, the Sinner doth not ſo eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what is good and true. <hi>A deceived Heart hath turned him aſide,</hi> Iſa. 44. 20. So it is always, when one ſtarts or goes out of the good Way: And likewiſe the ſame hinders it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102492:37"/> from coming in; as, a ſecret Imagination that it is ſoon enough, or, pray have me excuſed for this and the like Reaſon. There is an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Kind of Surmiſes or Imaginations.</p>
               <p>But in Alluſion to what our Saviour ſaith, take heed how ye hear, ſo let People take heed how they think, for God diſcerns their inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Thoughts, as plainly as if they were wrote upon their Face, or ſpoken out aloud in the Market-place. However they keep them cloſe and concealed from his faithful People and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, leaſt they ſhould find ſomething in the Word of Truth to convince them of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Miſtake, ſo that they need not to go on therein; yet in the mean while known to God are all of them, and he will one Day ſpread them forth before their Faces in the Sight of Angels and Men; and lay it all open, and detect the whole by his eternal Truth. They are ſo angry and vexed at preſent, as if we could inform God who ſearches all things out and knows the very Secrets of the Heart; or as if we did bring their Sins to Remembrance, when himſelf hath declared that he conſiders all their Ways,: Though he doth now <hi>hold his Tongue,</hi> Hab. 1. 13. yet <hi>our God ſhall come and ſhall not keep Silence,</hi> Pſal. 50. 3. He ſhall rehearſe the Thoughts, Words and Actions of the whole Life. <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done and I kept Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: Thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch an one as thy ſelf, but I will reprove thee and ſet them in order before thine Eyes,</hi> Pſal. 50. 21. The Time, Place, Circumſtances and Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102492:38"/> will be all manifeſted, and as they were Day by Day committed, ſo they ſhall be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned up. In the Midſt of Tranſgreſſion there was no ſuch notice taken of them becauſe God kept Silence; but it might even then have been known that our God would reprove People for the ſame; becauſe even then he did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do it a little by his Word and Servants, and by the ſtill Voice of his Spirit within them. And though we know nothing of one another, yet God is pleaſed to convey into our Mind ſome ſecret Intents and cloſe Imaginations, giving us thereby to underſtand that he knows them all; for he gave us this Knowledge. And if the World is now ſo enraged when only a few Thoughts of their Heart are revealed, good God, what Fear and Confuſion will they be in? What Terror and ſtrange Amazement will poſſeſs them when all the Thoughts of all the Sons of Men ſince they have been created on the Earth, ſhall be fully manifeſted. <hi>For there is not a Word in my Tongue, but lo, O Lord, thou knoweſt it altogether,</hi> Pſal. 139. 4. <hi>And then all Evil corrupt Communications, Lies, vain Swearing, falſe Oaths, Blasphemies, hard Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es againſt God,</hi> Jude. 15. Reproaches of his People, Slander and Backbitings, with all the Sins of the Tongue, which is a World of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, ſhall be ſummed up: So he, who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth all their Ways, ſhall bring up all their ungodly Deeds, wicked and unjuſt Actions; the firſt whereof they did endeavour to hide from
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102492:38"/> the Saints here on Earth, and the latter even from their common Neighbours. If they had but the Knowledge of God, they would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all this at the preſent Time; for even now we live under him whoſe Eyes run to and fro throughout the whole Earth, and are in every Place beholding the Evil and the Good. He hath given his Word which is a Diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart; for that ſpeaks out concerning them, and declare them unto us. <hi>Neither is any Creature that is not manifeſt in his Light, but all things are naked and opened unto the Eyes of him with whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. 4. 11. Not only divine Revelation, but common Reaſon teacheth the very ſame: For as our Lord argued to the Phariſees, <hi>Ye Fools, did not be that made that which is without, make that which is within alſo?</hi> Luke 11. 40. ſo he who faſhioned every Part of us, muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe know all that is therein. He that planted the Ear, ſhall he not hear? He that formed the Eye, ſhall he not ſee? So he, who created the Soul with Powers to know, muſt alſo much more know himſelf, and alſo every thing which ſhe thinks or doth. The Scripture in ſundry Places aſſerts this all-knowing Property of God. There is no Darkneſs nor Shadow of Death, where the Workers of Iniquity may hide themſelves: And they which would not commit Wickedneſs before ſuch a Man, who perhaps hath the faint Image of God within, as to hate and loath Evil; and therefore, if
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102492:39"/> ſuch a Spy is in their Preſence (as they term him) there is a Secret Awe and Reſtraint upon their Spirits. But why might not theſe underſtand that there is one greater among them who ſees and beholds all that they do: Who is holy and hateth all Wickedneſs? who is the Judge of all Men, and will certainly call them to an Account for what they are now a doing. Yet the Senſe of him doth not keep them off from evil-doing: Which happens only from their Ignorance and Forgetfulneſs of him. For, would not his Holineſs and Purity keep them in perfect Order and Subjection, when one who is a leſs Partaker thereof than a Drop to the whole Ocean doth caſt a Damp and clog that they cannot ſo freely enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin, nor run on ſo uncontroulably in the broad Way which leads unto Deſtruction. When now they would refrain to do ſuch a thing if a ſtrict Demand and Account ſhould be required of them, would they not much more abſtain if they were ſenſibly aſſured that the Lord himſelf ſhall come with Ten Thouſand of his Saints to execute Judgment upon all. He now ſitteth in the Heavens and prepareth his Seat for Judgment; and as ſure as this is the Time of Trial, ſo there will be a Day of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and rendring unto every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Deeds. Who are now ſo averſe and afraid to hear or ſpeak of him, when we know but little more than of his Name and Truth, which we hear with the Ear, and ſee
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102492:39"/> it thus written of him, and conceive in the Mind. But how will they fly back and be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, when God himſelf ſhall come, and the very things ſhall be manifeſted whereof it is now a Vexation only to underſtand the Report. Who would not receive the Kingdom of God when heretofore it was in Word, how muſt they ſubmit unto it when it ſhall be actually in Deed? When he ſent a Meſſage to reign over them, and Officers to ſet up his Kingdom, but they did not receive that and did evil entreat them whom he had ſent, what will they do when the King himſelf ſhall come with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and miſerably deſtroy thoſe wicked Men? He now ſpeaketh from Heaven by his Word, and the Time draweth nigh when he will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the ſame. This Word drops in by way of ſilent Thought to the Heart; or it is heard by hearing of the Ear, from a Fellow Creature, or it is conveyed unto us by Means of Ink and Paper; all which is but a ſtill Voice, whereby God doth now manifeſt himſelf unto us. So he ſent his only Son the eternal Word, which was made Fleſh, who dwelt here and became as one of us, that God might be more familiar and acquainted with our Nature; and alſo to try whether we would thus receive and obey him. <hi>But as many as received him, to them he gave Power to become the Sons of God,</hi> John 1. 12. It is ſaid nothing is more free than a Gift; ſo the tendring and offer thereof is free, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Receipt and Acceptance thereof is a free Act, for it might be refuſed.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:102492:40"/>
               <p>If God the Father had ſhewn his Greatneſs and Glory, then People would run unto him as now they ignorantly ſtay away for a little ſhadow and repreſentation thereof from the World. But when he hath revealed himſelf in a little contemptible Appearance, this will prove whether they will take their Lot and Portion with that at preſent, and expect the greater things to come. Whether notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Vail and Covering drawn over the things of God, they can yet diſcern the Glory that excelleth? whether they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Word, which hath ſpoken of more than what is now ſeen or had. Again, If he ſhould at preſent reveal himſelf in his Majeſty and Power, then People would preſently yield unto him who is mighty, much more than they now pay Reverence and Submiſſion to the King and great Men, as he who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, doth exceed the greateſt and higheſt of the Sons of Men. VVhich is ſo infinite, that no Compaſſion can be made to expreſs the juſt and true diſtance. But when this God hideth himſelf, when he ſeems as one aſleep, and taketh no notice; when he doth not actually give his Favour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to them that do well, nor yet doth he immediately Manifeſt forth his ſevere diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt them who ſin and tranſgreſs; when it is alike with Subjects and Enemies. VVho fear God, and who fear him not; this will exerciſe our Faith and waiting, as alſo prove their Rebellion and Contempt.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:102492:40"/>
               <p>Indeed there are the Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings annexed, and all muſt partake of the one, or they are liable to the other: But yet the Conditions of one are put into our power; and none, unleſs by his own fault or wilfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, doth fall under the other. His Kingdom and Dominion is over all; every thing that can be named, or doth any where exiſt; but then he ruleth over them according to their ſeveral Natures. The VVinds and Sea Obey him neceſſarily; Beaſts, Birds, and Creeping things, go conſtantly according to that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct implanted in them; which is as it were a Law unto them. To Man is committed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation and Reaſon for to guide him; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, he may diſregard, act contrary, or yield unto and comply with its dictates. So much is left to his freedom and choice. There is ſet before him Life and Good, Death and Evil, with a repeated inculcation to chooſe Life. And though when theſe two oppoſite things are ſimply and abſtractedly propoſed, every one hath ſo much Underſtanding as would preſerve, and make him happy: Yet the great doubt and miſtake is concerning the way and means of one or the other; which alſo are laid before the Sons of Men, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to their choice and liberty, as the End is. It might firſt of all be rationally and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly concluded, That where the End is Right, Good and Deſirable, ſo is every thing that neceſſarily tends towards it; for upon a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102492:41"/> Stock and Foundation there can never be a ſure Building. So contrariwiſe, where the End is diſmal, and feared by every one, they might well ſuſpect the ſeveral ſteps leading to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and conſequently refrain to move a ſtep further, which they might if they would. As they evidently ſee and know that God hath put it into their power at firſt to go into one way or another; and when they are in a little, they may ſtand ſtill or go backwards, or rather turn aſide from out of it: So likewiſe by God's Grace and Invitation, <hi>They may come unto Life,</hi> John 5. 40. and it is <hi>of themſelves that they fall into Death and Destruction,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 9.</p>
               <p>This laſt thing being attendant to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of coming unto God and Obeying his Voice, doth ſeem to imply as if they were forced. But if ſo, they would actually do it; for are Men ſtronger than He? God is All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and muſt prevail, if it were the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his Heart to compel Mankind unto his Obedience. He could raiſe up Hell from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and ſet it evidently before our Eyes, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did the Fiery Furnace. He could even now Command his Angels to ſound the Trumpet (as at the laſt day when the dead ſhall hear his Voice) that every Nation, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Language, all that are now living, ſhould fall down and VVorſhip him, or they ſhall be caſt into Hell. He could ſo order it even at this preſent time, That thoſe which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102492:41"/> do Iniquity, ſhall be caſt immediately thereupon into a Furnance of Fire; and then the boldeſt worker thereof would fear, tremble and refrain. He could ſtir up thoſe terrible ones from under the Earth, Devils and infernal Spirits, the Executioners of his VVrath (who ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awe poor Mortals) all one, as a mighty King with his Armies doth now make them do this or that thing at his pleaſure. For hath he not the ſame power as Man to whom he gave being, and hath before committed unto him the Power of doing whatever he doth. Cannot he who ſitteth upon the Circle of the Earth, and the Inhabitants thereof are as Graſhoppers, do as much, or rather more, than any two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed Creature that now walks thereon? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the High and Lofty One, who ſitteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne, and commandeth over the Armies in Heaven (who are greater in power and might as that wide place above is bigger than this ſpot of ground here where we dwell) ſend forth his Authority, and execute the ſame here? Is this too far off when it is his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool? for he filleth all places and all things, even thoſe under the Earth with his preſence. <hi>If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there,</hi> Pſal. 139. 8. Even now he ſends ſorth his Lightning unto the Ends of the Earth, and his Arrows go throughout the World. But becauſe God doth not yet manifeſt his Power, and ſhew forth all his Might, a thought doth ariſe in them who know not God, as if he cannot do
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102492:42"/> this. They, who have a little more knowledge are ſometimes apt to imagine, That becauſe he acts here by outward means, which are but little and ſmall, that by reaſon of them is the Defect; and they are unable to atchieve ſuch great and mighty things? whereas his infinite Wiſdom and Glory are here to be ſeen in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining ſtrength out of weakneſs. VVho firſt made, he will alſo enable them to perform what he would have them to do. He can ſend forth his Angels or other Inſtruments, whom we have not known, nor heard of as yet.</p>
               <p>A Temptation doth ariſe, that though God can, yet he will not do thus; for ſo we have heard in Old Time, and in our days over and over, and yet <hi>all things continue as they were ſince the Creation.</hi> But the Apoſtle in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5, 6. anſwers this by what God did of Old, both by Creation of, and Drowning the VVorld. <hi>For this they are willingly ignorant of, That by the Word of God the Heavens were of Old, and the Earth ſtamding out of the Water, and in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; whereby the World that then was, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed with Water periſhed. But the Heavens and the Earth which are now, by the ſame Word are kept in ſtore, reſerved unto Fire against the day of Judgment and perdition of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly Men.</hi> That ſame VVord which ſpake them firſt into Being, acquainted <hi>Noah, Gen</hi> 6. of the intended Flood; and afterwards this ſame word brought the VVaters; for God Commanded them. The ſame VVord hath likewiſe ſaid, that it ſhall be
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102492:42"/> thus in the latter days, to which we now haſte.</p>
               <p>Thus it is determined upon all thoſe who in the mean time have been Ungodly, or are, or ſhall hereafter not give regard to the great God above, or are diſobedient to him; for all ſuch are ungodly, without God in the VVorld, who do not live in ſenſe of Submiſſion and Duty under him. Theſe might even now conceive, that as in the beginning the Lord laid the Foundations of the Earth and it abideth, as they find by moving and dwelling thereon. As they ſee the gathering of the VVaters which is called Sea; and as we behold the Heavens upheld, and the Stars in their Courſes and Places: So ſurely doth the threatning lye againſt ſuch, and will be fulfilled, when theſe things ſhall be ſo changed, as we are further foretold of. As before it was obſerved of the ſtedfaſtneſs and immutability of the Promiſe, from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. So from 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. it may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of the utmoſt certainty of the Evil and Good things there ſpoken of: They ſeem therefore to be out of ſight, and to come to prove how we in the mean while will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and affected towards them. There is a little imperfect Good in the One at preſent, and a leſſer Evil and Harm in the other; but God will ſo add further, that the one ſhall be perfected in Reward and Happineſs, the other ſhall end in Puniſhment and Miſery. My <hi>Son forget not my Law, but let thine heart keep my Commandments, for Length of Days, and long</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:102492:43"/> 
                  <hi>Life and Peace ſhall they add unto you,</hi> Prov. 3. 1, 2. and when the firſt is ended, there ſhall ſucceed Immortality and Glory: And the Peace here ſhall go out in Raviſhment, Extaſie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable Rejoycing. So again, Sin, which now hurts for a moment, doth bring on Torment for ever. What occaſions Sorrow and Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth deliver over to the VVorm which ſhall never die. VVhat occaſions Sickneſs and Pain, doth likewiſe bring forth Death and the Vengeance of Eternal Fire. All that is ſeen or had here, is but an earneſt of like and worſe things to come. The leſs do fore-run, and give notice of the greater. And as in the former caſe, by the comfort and ſatisfaction of the one, we ſhould much more deſire and pray after that which exceedeth: So by the ſenſible incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and trouble of the latter way, we ſhould much more abhor and dread the End thereof, which is Death. As we now taſte and feel it is thus, ſo we may believe, and be fully aſſured it ſhall be ſo hereafter, as the faithful and true VVitneſs ſaith, <hi>Behold I have told you before.</hi> By the real Good of one way we may well depend further upon the ſubſtance of things hoped for. By the hurt and deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the other, we may be ſufficiently fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned of the Deſtruction and Miſery in that way.</p>
               <p>The Nature of Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Exhortation and Dehortation, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings, do denote that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102492:43"/> Man is left to his Liberty and Freedom. All theſe do inform and acquaint him how things ſtand pertaining to him, That he might par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Good, and avoid the Evil. God hath thus eſtabliſhed the Connexion and Order of things. They are ſet before Mankind, and placed ſo near, that they are become as cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appendant to him as his Fleſh and Spirit, ſo they muſt have the one or the other. His trial is appointed in things abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, which he cannot be without, as Meat, Drink, and Rayment to the Body, and in Thoughts as to the Soul, which are the very Eſſence of it; for the Soul will ceaſe to be, when it ſhall ceaſe to think. And leſt the Soul ſhould degenerate into Sloth and Bruitiſhneſs, of that we are rouzed up to take heed by the Parable of the unprofitable Servant, whoſe Doom was, <hi>Cast him into outer Darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> VVho would not receive and aſcend up towards the Light, but walked all his days in the Miſt of Ignorance, He ſhall be thruſt down to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Dungeon, and be confined unto utter Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For the former ſeeming Eaſe and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, there will ſucceed continued ſelf-indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. His Soul was then employed about ſomewhat; and if not about that Talent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with him by the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh, yet he had ſome little Thought, or ſeeming excuſe for his Refuſal and Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The knowledge was conveyed in; the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102492:44"/> Obligation and Neceſſity thereof was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Mind, and there was a willing delay and putting it off. In thoſe debates and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings within, there is a manifeſt thinking this or that way. Now the Scale turns on this ſide, and then on that. And as there is a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to think freely, ſo there is a power to do accordingly, or a contrary froward going on in his way, or a wretched doing nothing at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord knoweth our frame,</hi> Pſal. 103. 14. the diſpoſal and tendency of each part of our Nature; and accordingly in his VVord and Truth application is made to the Children of Men. To this end are thoſe ſeveral kinds of Expoſtulation in the Pſalms, Prophets, and throughout the Old and New Teſtament. Some things are to inform and teach the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, others are to ſubdue and bring over the VVill; and the ſeveral Affections are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſpoken unto. So that read where you will, you may find ſome part of your Soul moved. And then there is the example of Saints recorded, who were Men of like Paſſions and Infirmities with our ſelves, that we alſo might do the ſame, which others have done before us. God addreſſeth himſelf to us as we are Men, to judge of the equality of his ways, and of what he ſaith and commandeth us. He bringeth us up, and implants a capacity to know the Good, and refuſe the Evil. He giveth Senſes to diſcern between one and the other.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102492:44"/> He acquaints us over and over with the very Nature of things at preſent, and alſo fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warns us of things to come.</p>
               <p>Survey the whole Diſpenſation and Exerciſe of God's Dominion over us. Conſider each part and method thereof. Look into the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Kingdom, Remember his doings of Old Time, Think upon what he doth now; and alſo take in the Conſummation of all what he hath ſaid and ſworn he will yet perform: Then thou mayeſt underſtand, that as he made People free, ſo he would govern them as ſuch. He would have them ſerve him with joyfulneſs and gladneſs of Heart, and what they do it ſhould be with a willing and ready Mind; for the Lord loves the anſwer of ſuch a Soul, when he ſaith, <hi>Seek ye my Face,</hi> Thy Face Lord will I ſeek. That comes at firſt as ſoon as he is called, and afterwards is in a continual rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to receive further Direction and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and then is in an actual and ſpeedy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the ſame. VVhere is a willing Mind there is no ſeeking out Excuſes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays. There is no ſhifting and trying to put it off; There is no Controverſie or Diſpute of Mind, whether I ſhould ſerve God preſently or not. For if there is a right Knowledge of him, and of the Terms upon which we are to enter into his Service, we come as readily to him as one that was hired to the beſt of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters according to the Fleſh, who will give the greateſt VVages, and moſt kind Uſage. Saith
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102492:45"/> our Saviour unto his Diſciples and Followers, <hi>Henceforth I call you not Servants; for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant knoweth not what his Lord doth. But I have called, you Friends,</hi> John 15. 15. Here is yet a nearer Relation and Honour, to be admitted into Friendſhip with him who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Faith apprehends this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Priviledge, and eſteems of it more than to have for aſſured Friends the King, all the Nobility and Gentry of this or the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nations; Or if Love is leſſened when it is divided into ſo many Particulars, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to have two, three, or a few only of the greateſt and wiſeſt Perſonages on Earth. Chriſt unto the Believers Soul is the chiefeſt of Ten Thouſand; nay, he is more to her than all the Perſons and Things in the VVorld. Now where is an intimate Love and Union, (as we expect his Grace and Benefits, and hope for Gifts from him) ſo likewiſe we muſt do the things he ſaith, and whatever he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Our Voice and Deſire is, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly;</hi> and his Anſwer is again to the Church, <hi>And behold I come quickly; and my Reward is with me, to give to every Man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as his work ſhall be,</hi> Rev. 22. 12. And ſeeing the time allotted for that VVork is ſhort, though it was ſpoken to the Traytor <hi>Judas,</hi> it may be alſo applied to his faithful Diſciples and Followers, <hi>What thou haſt to do, do quickly.</hi> VVe have his own Example and Words for it, <hi>I muſt work the Works of him</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:102492:45"/> 
                  <hi>that ſent me while it is Day: The Night cometh when no Man can work,</hi> John 9. 4. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he did go about doing good and preaching the Kingdom of God, making known all things he had heard from his Father. The Wiſe Man calleth upon us, <hi>Whatſoever thy Hand find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee to do, do it with all thy Might: For there is no Work, nor Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Grave whither thou goeſt,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 10. So whatever God and his Chriſt commandeth and requireth of thee, do it with all conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Speed and as ſoon as thou canſt before the Opportunity ſlip from thee, or the Means be taken away, or thy ſelf be cut off; for thou art but Fleſh and always dying. After this is done God may have more for thee: He will proportion thy Reward according to thy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. If thou diminiſheſt ought from that thou wilt loſe ſo much of a greater Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. The more thou doſt at this preſent, the more thou wilt receive for all Eternity: What is done each Day or Hour, is laying up a Treaſure for many Ages.</p>
               <p>There may be ſomewhat of this ſignified in the Words of our Saviour, who ſpeaketh the ſame to us as he did to the Diſciples, <hi>Ye ſay that there are Four Months and then cometh Harveſt: Lift up your Eyes, for the Fields even now are white unto Harveſt,</hi> John 4. 35. And <hi>he that reapeth, gathereth Fruit unto everlaſting Life.</hi> We may think and deceive our ſelves that ſuch a Work is to be done hereafter, when if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102492:46"/> throughly, all things are now ready for the Performance of the ſame. But admitting it were not to be done until then, yet ſuch good Acts may be done in the mean while which are preparatory to that, as the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman fits all things in the mean while; or we may in the Space between ſerve God to ſome other End and Purpoſe: That no Day paſs over our Head without doing ſome thing to the Glory of God and to the Benefit of Souls. Every thing here is in order to eternal Life; and as we are here always going towards that, and the Life we now live is continually haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning towards its Period; ſo we ſhould at all times make Proviſion againſt this ſhall fail to be received up into the other, that we may there continually partake of ſomewhat which we have done here. Indeed the Fruits of the Earth do ſpring up and are ripe at ſuch cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Seaſons of the Year according to the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate or Countrey; but ſtill the Husbandman hath ſome Employment all the Year round. The Kingdom of God over the Souls of Men is not confined to Times and Seaſons, as in ſuch an Age or Part of Life, to ſuch a Month or Day of the Year. But this Work may be carrying on at all Times and Seaſons. The Word may be preached in Seaſon and out of Seaſon, at Summer or VVinter, Spring or Autumn, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath or VVeek-day, in the Day-time or at Mid-night, as they are journeying or ſitting ſtill, in the Cloſet, Family or Congregation.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102492:46"/> 
                  <hi>Truth ſhall ſpring out of the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 85. 11. at what time it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to open the Fountains of the great Depth. And as the VVind bloweth when and where it liſteth, ſo he ſhall give his Spirit to ſearch it out. So again Righteouſneſs ſhall look down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when the Lord ſhall pour down his Spirit from on high; which as he hath done ſeveral Times already, ſo it may acquaint us further of the things there. He may inſtruct his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as thoſe of old, in what Diſpoſition of Body and Soul they muſt be in for to receive it. To get the foregoing Qualifications of Faith, Knowledge, Love of God, Obedience, Holineſs, Humility, convenient Retirement and ſeparating from their Brethren that they may the more approach unto God. Theſe things do not ſo much depend upon the outward Circumſtances of ſet and definite Times of the Year, but they come to paſs at what Time pleaſeth the Father, and we receive the Grace and uſe the Means to be Partakers thereof.</p>
               <p>Known unto God are the great things he will do for his Church; for they are fixed in his eternal Purpoſe and Determination, it <hi>is not for us to know the Times and Seaſons which the Father hath put in his own Power,</hi> Acts 1. 7. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the very Reaſon why theſe are not clearly revealed and manifeſted unto us, is leaſt in the mean while we ſhould neglect our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. Our Minds might ſo run upon what
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102492:47"/> things are to be done in the Generations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, that we ſhould leave undone what ought to be done in this Generation wherein we now live. As the VVoman of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſaith, <hi>When the Meſſias is come he will tell us all things,</hi> John 8. 25. ſo we might be apt to apprehend it, as to refuſe to learn any thing in the mean while: And when it is promiſed, <hi>The Earth ſhall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord as the Waters cover the Sea,</hi> Iſa. 11. 9. VVe might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with our former Ignorance, and reject any further Knowledge and Inſtruction in the mean while.</p>
               <p>Even thoſe great things of old time have been tranſacted by outward Means; and we ought ſtill to uſe thoſe Means which are in our Power, to put them forth with all our Skill and Might, and then let the Lord do what ſeemeth him good. We know not at firſt what a Bleſſing and Succeſs he may give unto them, but we may ſomewhat perceive it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Then things may riſe up beyond our Expectations, when in the Beginning we are apt to diſtruſt and faint in our Mind. Had our ſelves done nothing, or after we had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken it, then let it fall, then it was our own Refuſal that we were not Inſtruments in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Work of the Lord; or he might take it from us, and make choice of and give it unto others who ſhould throughly perform his Will. If the Way is ſhewed unto us, and we are put in ſuch a Capacity, we have alſo an
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102492:47"/> Impulſe and Preſſing of Mind to the ſame, and the VVork is right and good; as appears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently from his VVord and the Examples of old, there we may, and indeed ought to walk in that VVay, and actually do according to the Power given us, and alſo comply with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of a rectified and truly informed Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If God may be glorified by ſuch an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Good may be done unto others, this ſhould be indeed performed: And ſeeing it ſhould be done by ſome one, why not by thee to whom he hath given the Knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, endued with Ability, and is ſtirring thee up by his Spirit. We may learn from <hi>Exodus</hi> 4. 10, 11, 12, 13. that God is not pleaſed with Excuſes or Delays, or with alledging our own Imperfections; for he made us at firſt, and can alſo mend and increaſe what he hath begun. He ſent forth further Strength and Ability ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the thing requires. The ſtammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lips may at length ſpeak plain as in the Beginning of Speech. The Voice, which was haſty and confuſed, may become clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct: And who acquaints at firſt in general with the Errand that he ſhould go to ſuch a Place, and do ſuch a thing, will afterwards according to his own divine Method in <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 6. teach particularly what he ſhall ſay: And put the very Words into our Mouth a little before, or <hi>in the very ſame Hour,</hi> Mat. 10. 19. juſt as they are to be uttered forth: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring ſtill that we are but Inſtruments in the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102492:48"/> Hands of God. We are to receive the Thoughts he puts into our Heart, and to ſpeak them out with our Lips; but we can ſay no more nor think of pertaining to him than what he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts and puts into our Mind. We are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute what he puts into the Power of our Hands, but we can do no more. Our God doth not require more than he hath given. Thoſe Talents are to be exerciſed and traded withal which he hath committed unto us; but he will never call us to Account for more than we have received: So we are to uſe Diligence and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour according to what we can.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Place we ſhould pray unto God, <hi>O learn me true <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding and Knowledge that I may keep thy Commandments.</hi> Now theſe are either things to be abſtained from, or things to be done. The firſt are properly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions or Forbiddings; but the Word Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment imports Duty, which is to be done. That muſt be diſcerned and known before it can be begun; and becauſe there may be Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances and Oppoſitions, thoſe alſo are to be ſeen and overcome that it may be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the Way to Heaven there are many Turnings aſide, which we are to be acquainted withal and avoid that we may keep on ſtill in the right Way; for if we go out there is ſo much Time and Labour loſt to no purpoſe, which might have ſet ſo far on. The beſt Uſe hereof is to be more careful for the future to keep on right. In every worldly Buſineſs
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102492:48"/> and Deſign there are ſuch foregoing Means. And if they do at firſt hit upon thoſe which are true and prudent, they do ſooner perform the matter in hand; but if they make uſe of falſe and fooliſh Means, they go backward or round about, and ſo they are further off or they wander: And then either they do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, or it is much a longer Time before they obtain what they would have.</p>
               <p>Indeed there is another kind of Method in things pertaining to God than what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made uſe of as to the things of this VVorld: For though the ſame VViſdom, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Activity are to be uſed towards the future and ſpiritual things as we ſee People do in their preſent Deſigns and Enterpriſes, yet we ought not to venture upon all manner of Means. <hi>For the Word of God is right and all his Works are done in Truth,</hi> Pſal. 33. 4. That Word is to be made our Direction all along, and we are to do nothing for God but what is holy and good: So we learn manifeſtly from his revealed Will, and alſo we find by the Succeſs and Event thereof, for if his own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Servants do turn aſide from the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment delivered unto them, or do that which is ſinful or doubtful (not being of Faith and full Perſwaſion of Mind) it doth not proſper unto them, but they are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly defeated; even the Wicked and Tanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, which do moſt flouriſh and have the things they deſire and endeavour after, have
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102492:49"/> not a comfortable Enjoyment thereof, or they are given to vain Imaginations, tormenting Deſires, continual Reſtleſſneſs and Turmoil of Mind: So they have plenty, but no Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. If there is but one <hi>Achan,</hi> a ſingle Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh Wedge, this troubleth the whole Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Iſraelites are ſmitten before their Enemies. And this is many times a Reaſon, not only of the common Afflictions of God's faithful People in their private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but alſo his Church hath laboured under long continued Perſecutions and Adverſities; out of which they have attempted to redreſs themſelves by unwarrantable and evil Means, which have been fruſtrate and came to naught, and then by giving occaſion to the Enemy to think that they were not ſo holy as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and thereupon they were kept faſter in Bondage, and tormented yet more.</p>
               <p>We ought carefully to uſe the Means, but we are in no wiſe to truſt in them, nor ſeek to the Arm of Fleſh as to put any Reliance thereon. God is exceeding jealous of his own Glory, that as all things are of him, ſo he would have all aſcribed unto him: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth purpoſely make uſe of little out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means, that it may be known that they have not done it, but he who ſits above. He acts in an inviſible Manner: He works and we ſee him not. By the ſilent but effectual Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of his Spirit. <hi>Which the World receiveth not becauſe it ſeeth him not,</hi> John 14. 17. They
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102492:49"/> do not underſtand, but yet they are moved at the Preſence of him in whom they imagine it dwells? His Fleſh is the ſame with theirs, and yet they <hi>narrowly look on and conſider him.</hi> But if they had a ſpiritual Eye, or if they had an inward Senſe to perceive ſomewhat of the ſame Nature within themſelves, they would be much more over-awed with that: And yet they would be inexpreſſibly more moved with the Preſence of the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh <hi>As Wax melteth before the Fire, ſo let the Wicked periſh at the Preſence of God,</hi> Pſal. 68. 2. which will be really fulfilled when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall bow the Heavens and come down. Even now at the Manifeſtation of the Spirit of God, Satan and his Legions do fly and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. The Devils believe and tremble; for they more quickly diſcern and fear than Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Fleſh; and being more apprehenſive of God's Power, and alſo being conſcious that they are liable to it, they either make haſte to get away, or they lie under a more grievons Terror and Apprehenſion thereof againſt the Time it ſhall be executed upon them. <hi>The Lord rideth upon a ſwift Cloud, and ſhall come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Egypt, <hi>and the Idols ſhall be moved at his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> Iſa. 19. 1. As Light doth diſpel Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, one Beam or Ray of the Sun drives it away when it overſpreads the Face of the whole Earth: So it is of the ſpiritual Light and of the ſpiritual Darkneſs; where the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Light doth appear and ſhoot it ſelf
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102492:50"/> forth, it makes all Ignorance and Error to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vaniſh away.</p>
               <p>The Father of Lights doth ſometimes ſend out a Ray and Communication of his own Nature. <hi>O ſend out thy Light and thy Truth,</hi> Pſal. 43. 3. <hi>Thou that dwellest between the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims ſhine forth,</hi> Pſal. 80. 1. He now and then appears a little more, and makes a Diſcovery of himſelf. The God of all things, who hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf (if I may ſo expreſs it) behind the Skreen of his Creatures, doth look out a little. Who hath put a Vail on his Face, he doth a little draw it aſide. Who hath dark Waters and thick Clouds to cover him, yet he looks out from behind the Pillar; and as he troubled the Egyptians of old, ſo doth he even now ſeem to diſturb the Inhabitants of the Earth; for ſo they are diſturbed when they have any Apprehenſion or ſpiritual Sight of him. And therefore they avoid it and they ſhut their Eyes againſt him. <hi>Lord, when thy Hand is lifted up they will not ſee, but they ſhall ſee,</hi> Iſa. 26. 11. As long as they can refuſe the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, they will refuſe it: As long as they can reſiſt and deſpiſe his Righteouſneſs and Truth, they will do ſo: But at length there ſhall ſuch an abundant Meaſure thereof be poured down, that they ſhall both know and conſider, tremble and be aſtoniſhed do whatever they can.</p>
               <p>By the Help of God one of his Saints (who is the ſame with others) ſhall put an hundred
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102492:50"/> to Flight, and Ten ſhall chaſe a Thouſand. And this ſhall not be done by Sword or Spear, by outward Strength or Power of the Hands, but with the weakeſt Member and lighteſt thing in Man, <hi>viz.</hi> It ſhall be done by the Tongue and by the Breath of his Lips. <hi>And he ſhall ſmite the Earth with the Rod of his Mouth, and with the Breath of his Lips ſhall he ſlay the Wicked,</hi> Iſa. 11. 4. The Lord ſhall put Words into their Mouth that the Ears which hear thereof ſhall tingle: And though they are backward to hear, yet he ſhall cauſe them to hear. Now Words are vain, light, and the Sound of them ſoon paſſeth away: They may be ſlighted off when they come from a weak and helpleſs Man: For, doth he talk of great things who is little and contemptible himſelf? Doth he ſpeak of Power and Might, who is but Fleſh, a feeble Creature, and like a Reed ſhaken with the Wind? Doth he preach of Rewards and Puniſhments in whoſe Power it is not either to do good or hurt? For the utmoſt is a ſlight Pleaſure or little Inconvenience. Doth he talk of Kingdoms, Glory and Riches, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps himſelf is abject, vile and poor? Many ſuch like things might be objected againſt us if we came in our own Name, or if we did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them by our own Merit, Excellency and Power. But ſeeing we come in the Name of the Lord who hath created and ordained all things; who will do nothing, but he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it to his Servants, the Prophets. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102492:51"/> his eternal Purpoſe and Decree is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Mankind, he will ſome way make it known unto them, by acquainting it to ſome who are to publiſh it unto others. He hath ſo ordered that it might be known. They do all hear the Rumour and they might <hi>ſeek after,</hi> Acts 15. 17. and find it.</p>
               <p>Salvation and the good things of God are forced upon none. They may be brought near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and preſſed more urgently upon ſome than upon others, yet ſtill there is Liberty of Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. Again, they are not ſo far off from any, but they may come near and receive them; and to whom it is moſt inculcated and offered, yet it is not all done to their Hand. For Trial is had whether they will ſeek yet further. There muſt be ſomewhat of Man's own Act and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>God doth manifeſt himſelf to be friendly and loving unto us, by that conſtant Proviſion of temporal Mercies, and alſo by doing all that lies on his Part for ſpiritual good things. It is expected what we will do reciprocally as to what he doth require of us. Saith the Son of God, <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you. Continue ye in my Love. If ye keep my Commandments, ye ſhall abide in my Love, even as I have kept my Father's Commandments and abide in his Love,</hi> John 15. 9, 10. Here we have Aſſurance of the divine Favour to us; and we are inſtructed how we may continue and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our good Will towards him, <hi>viz.</hi> by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102492:51"/> keeping his Commandments. God is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter of Perſons; but whoſoever of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men doth this, he is accepted with him. <hi>Whoſoever doth the Works of</hi> Abraham, <hi>he is a Friend of God, as</hi> Abraham <hi>was,</hi> James 2. 23. which Word, <hi>Friend,</hi> imports that we do a thing preſently and readily at his requiring. By much Importunity we we may get a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from a common Neighbour; which he will do not out of Affection and Eſteem to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, but to be freed from the Trouble which we give him by our Importunity. But where is real Love and Friendſhip, there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Readineſs to do mutual Offices even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other asks, or upon the leaſt Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſuch a thing would be acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
               <p>Now to apply the Caſe as it ſtands between God and Mankind. <hi>As ſoon as they hear of me, they ſhall obey me,</hi> Pſal. 18. 44. Nothing can be more juſt and reaſonable than that he ſhould require Obedience of his Creatures. Is he not more to all of them and to each ſingly than one Man is to another? He is infinitely more kind than Father or Mother, Husband, Friend or Brother; for even he ordained theſe Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſtirs up, (what he firſt put in) thoſe Bowels of Mercy and Compaſſion one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Of God are all things, and now he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth them as it pleaſeth him: So he is the Author of all good we ever received; and as he made, he doth now ſuſtain us, and loadeth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102492:52"/> us with Benefits. May he not expect ſomething from us, even all that we can render unto him: To acknowledge him in all things and to walk always in the Way he ſhews unto us, and to obſerve thoſe Commandments he gives us. Lord! How ſtrange is it, that a Creature ſhould make any Diſpute or Controverſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it? As we live by him, ſo it is meet we ſhould live as he would have us: Both the Members of Body and Faculties of Soul ſhould do according as he made and deſigned them. <hi>Therefore glorifie God in your Body and in your Spirit which are God's,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 20. The Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter makes Veſſels to ſerve for thoſe Uſes he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them; and other Artificers, which frame moving Inſtruments, make them turn or go as they pleaſe. Hath not the Lord the ſame Power and Underſtanding, who hath given ſuch Skill and Capacity to others. And he who faſhioned every Part of us might alſo have ordained that all within us ſhould neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily have ſo moved according to his Command and Will, as the Pulſe continually beats to keep Life and Motion. Who formed the Heart to turn either way, to Good or Evil, he might have determined it only to the firſt; who ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled us to think this or that, he might have confined us to good only; and he might have kept out from thence Wickedneſs and Vanity, all one as we now remain ignorant of many hidden and unſearchable things.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:102492:52"/>
               <p>If we had a right Knowledge of God we might diſcern how he is the Creator of us and of all things; who made my ſingle Perſon, he hath made Millions of the ſame Sort: And who created Mankind, he hath alſo Ten Thouſand times ten Thouſand ſeveral Sorts of Creatures both living and inanimate, all which are for his own Glory and to miniſter unto him. <hi>Who hath called the Generations from the Beginning,</hi> Iſa. 41. 4. and ordained them to ſucceed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after that Manner as we ſee they now do. And ſhall a ſingle Atom, an individual Duſt and Aſhes refuſe one Moment to comply with his Will? Nay, if ſeveral do ſo beſides, yet it is thine and the other's ſingle Diſobedience, which make up and encourage the Corruption of many. But let their Number be never ſo great, they are but as a Swarm of Flies and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts: And if they do mutter forth hard Speeches or commit ungodly Deeds, it is but in very little and ſudden Acts. And what is all this Sin and Wickedneſs to the whole World of Creatures which declare the Glory of God, and ſhew forth all his Praiſe? What are the refractory and ſtubborn Worms of the Earth to thoſe Armies of Heaven which fulfil all the Pleaſure of the Almighty? When he commands the Children of Men to do after this or that manner, they go on frowardly in the Way of their Heart, yet his Throne is for ever eſtabliſhed above the Circuit of Heaven; and there he ſits governing the World; and for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102492:53"/> ought we know a Thouſand others. God exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes the ſupream and alone Authority over all. <hi>Who maketh his Angels Spirits, and his Miniſters a flaming Fire.</hi> The Spirits are for the ſudden and quick Diſpatch of what he would have done, and for the effectual Performance of the ſame. And the flaming Fire is to burn up and conſume all that lets or hinders; and ſo make way for his Purpoſe: He hath already fixed and ordained things in their appointed Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Places: He hath appointed thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Motions and Bounds: He hath ſent forth his Word and given a Law. He garniſhed out the Heavens by his Wiſdom, and laid out the Foundations of the Earth by his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And we ſee it abideth according to his Ordinance; for all things ſerve him.</p>
               <p>Even Man doth all things which he is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily obliged unto; nay, which he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from, but with ſome viſible Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Man goeth forth to his Work and to his Labour until the Evening. Now there is as much Difficulty in that bodily Service as in the other Duty required of him by God, and yet he readily doth that, though it takes up more of his Strength and Time. The utmoſt of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Labour is for Meat, Drink and Raiment. Which God could have provided him without his own Labour, as he doth for the Ravens and Fowls of the Air. But now it is ſo ordered, to ſee if Man will labour for Food and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there he doth. <hi>Wherefore do ye</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:102492:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>spend Money for that which is not Bread, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for that which ſatisfieth not,</hi> Iſa. 55. 2. The Hand withereth, the Work ceaſeth, it is all determined within the ſeveral Days, both the Meat and Labour thereof. The firſt periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Mouth and is utterly conſumed in the Draught; the other is tireſome and not very material afterwards. The Wages are mean and ſatisfie not. But now God hath promiſed a Gift and Reward, which is eternal Life and Bleſſedneſs; And this is to be had upon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Conditions; which may be performed by the Soul, as the Bodily Service is done by the outward Members. <hi>Incline your Ear and come unto me. Hear and your Soul ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure Mercies of</hi> David, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3. Here God ſends forth an Invitation and Command, with the utmoſt Aſſurance of fulfilling the ſame. It is obſervable how the Preface runs, <hi>Incline your Ear and come unto me: Hear and your Soul ſhall live.</hi> He addreſſeth to the firſt Stubbornneſs and Averſation in Man, to get him to hear the Voice and Propoſals of his Maker, for he doth ſend forth ſo many gracious Words and preſſing Arguments, that whoſoever doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to them, he muſt be perſwaded. Our God can give alike and greater Reaſons why all Mankind ſhould ſerve him all the Days they live here upon Earth, as they do this or that for one another, or as they have Imaginations to walk in their own Ways.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:102492:54"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>God is not a Man that he ſhould Lye,</hi> Numb. 23. 9. as Courtiers and great Perſonages, very free in Promiſes, but ſlack in Performances. But he doth give the greateſt ſatisfaction, upon which whoſo conſiders, he may build the ſtrongeſt Aſſurance that he ſhall receive greater and more certain things by keeping cloſe and ſtedfaſt to his Covenant than by turning aſide from it. From the Intention and ſincere De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of our Soul, eſpecially when we ſeek for all Knowledge and Direction by the Word and Prayer, We may as ſurely conclude, as if God ſpake openly unto us out of a Cloud, or from the Battlements of Heaven. The conſideration of things to come may at all times weigh down the Thoughts and Temptation of the preſent. The Eye may be continually fixed on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Reward, and ſo diſdain and refuſe the ſudden Pleaſures of Sin, or the little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Tranſgreſſion. Such things may be for ever kept in the Imagination of the Hearts of People, that they ſhall ſeldom or never utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn aſide from God's Commandments, and which ſhall overcome the Temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the World, the Luſts of the Fleſh, the Deſires of the Mind, or the Dictates of Pride, Obſtinacy and Frowardneſs. What doth eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh and confirm thoſe who are already there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, will alſo bring others in the Right Way. God is able to bring thoſe home who at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are eſtranged from him, by the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which others have been before. He can
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102492:54"/> uſe and make known the ſame Perſwaſion, wherewith others are actually perſwaded, and they yield to take upon them the Yoke of his Son. He knows all the Hearts of the Children of Men, every ſingle Thought afar off, each particular moving and inclination. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth all their Works, and ſeeth all their Ways. As alſo he is not ignorant of all the Devices of the Enemy, To beat and keep them off from his Knowledge and Obedience. So that he can take away what lets and hinders, or over-rules it: And that which makes for Good, he can further and compleat the ſame. <hi>I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him,</hi> Iſa. 57. 18. who perceives all the Wandrings, can alſo lead him back. Who doth behold all the ſtumblings in Darkneſs. He can ſuddenly bring Light into the Soul, that ſhe may ſee her way. Who doth clearly diſcover all the imaginations of Evil, He can alſo preſently ſcatter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat them. If there be any Thoughts of Good, any wiſhes and deſires towards it; he can cheriſh them up into acts and habits of doing well. God, who maketh to Will, can alſo make to Do in his good Pleaſure, and in his own Order, though this is commonly after the other. He brings near that which was afar off, and inclines what before was averſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing. Who can underſtand, and alſo he doth know thoſe cloſe actings and contrivances, the ſecret and hidden things of the Heart, thoſe reſerved and innermoſt Thoughts, the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102492:55"/> Bottom Imaginations (if I may ſo expreſs it) or what yet lies under Ground, or is covered over in the inward Man: The deceitful Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Turnings are more than can be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned up. We cannot fathom and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all that lies in our own Heart, much leſs in others. But thou, O Lord, knoweſt all. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the Heart and try the Reins,</hi> to ſee and diſcover if there is any thing more. So he, who knows all things, can alſo apply things accordingly. He can adapt his Grace unto their Corruption, his Truth unto their Error, and his Mercy to all their former Sins. He hath a Balm to all their Sores, for who doth perfectly underſtand the Nature of that, and alſo the Remedy, there he can recover whom he will. Now God doth know through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Nature of every thing which he hath made. <hi>I have ſeen his Ways and will heal him: I will lead him alſo and reſtore Comforts to him and his Mourners,</hi> Iſa. 57. 18.</p>
               <p>God doth not things ſuddenly; for our Faith and Waiting are to be exerciſed in the mean while; and therefore his gracious Promiſes are commonly future, what he doth phraſe Thoughts of Good, even to give an expected End. Yet in the mean while he requires that we prepare and be found ready. To <hi>be as thoſe that wait for the coming of the Bridegroom, that when he comes we may open to him immediately,</hi> Luke 12. 36. Agreeable hereunto is the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and Example of thoſe of old. The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102492:55"/> all went as ſoon as ever they were called, and left their worldly Buſineſs. So did the Labourers in the Vineyard go as ſoon as they were ſeverally hired. Thoſe converted to the Chriſtian Faith believed and lived according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt or ſecond Time after they had heard it preached unto them. So when <hi>Paul</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth; he conferred not with Fleſh and Blood, he had nothing to do with carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations or worldly Inducements, no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Motive nor yet a like Danger and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience did hinder or excuſe with him, but he <hi>immediately went to</hi> Jeruſalem. Undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all theſe did for the beſt and God was well pleaſed with them. He did accept and reward them more than thoſe who ſeek out for Excuſe and Delay, or ſuch who firſt refuſe to hear his Gracious call; or if they do at any Time hear or it is made known unto them, yet they will not yield unto it.</p>
               <p>The Word of Exhortation ſtands continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for all People both young and old to hear and read it. The Spirit and the Bridegroom ſay always, <hi>come,</hi> There is one knocking at the Door of their Hearts for Admiſſion, God is ready at all Times to ſet up his Kingdom within us, his Law is already written in our Heart and inward Parts. He ſends his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets riſing up early and ſitting down late. Who being dead, ſpeak yet unto us in their Writings. There are conſtant Dictates of Mind to ſerve and obey our Maker. There
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102492:56"/> are Examples of thoſe who do it in our Age and Circumſtances of Life. There is hardly a Chapter or Verſe throughout the whole Bible, but ſome way or other calls and ſtirs us up. The Scripture is opened and alledged. The Word preached in the ſeveral Congregations throughout our Land, and in all the Nations of the World are a Sermon to us alſo: For we are the ſame Creatures and ſtand in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame Relation to the great God over all, as thoſe ſeveral Perſons who hear ſuch and ſuch Truths with their outward Ears. We might alſo know and hear more than we do; and thoſe who hear and underſtand are to declare it unto us, to acquaint their Neighbours and Kinsfolks, and they to others: So that the Word of God might dwell richly and have free Paſſage among us.</p>
               <p>There is a ſufficient Call and Warning to all People in their ſeveral Generations and Ages of Life, <hi>God now commandeth all Men every where to repent, becauſe he hath appointed a Day in the which he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs by that Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given Aſſurance unto all Men in that he hath raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from the Dead,</hi> Acts 17. 31. As every one knows Chriſt to be a Saviour, ſo there is the ſame Notice conveyed that he is to be our Judge: And as God ſhall bring every ſecret thing into Judgment, all the Actions of our Lives, for each ſingle Day will be called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: So it will be demanded why ſuch and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102492:56"/> ſuch did not come when they were called, as they ſenſibly knew by a powerful Conviction over their Spirits, when it was inculcated over and over, to Day if ye will hear his Voice har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not your Heart. When they might have conſidered more and more, and themſelves did find that the more they did conſider, the more they were preſſed inſtantly to cloſe with Chriſt; and therefore they did put off conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their Wayes. They might at ſuch an Opportunity have heard God's Word (which would have urged them to have turned from their evil Ways, and therefore they would not attend to them. They might at ſuch a Day and by ſuch Means have learned the Knowledge and Fear of the Lord, but they would not. His Statutes were laid before them, but they would not let the Ears hear which were made to hear; nor the Eyes ſee which were ordained for that End. And further, when the Thoughts thereof did recur to the Mind, they would put them far away. When God riſes up and enters into Judgment, how ſhall Men anſwer for ſuch things?</p>
               <p>And whoſoever now looketh upon or hears what is written in theſe Lines, and he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Truth and Sincerity of them, but if he ſhould go away and not comply with the Purport thereof, or be willingly ignorant, or take no notice for fear he ſhould be brought over unto God more ſuddenly than he other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe intended, how will he give account to the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102492:57"/> Judge of all Men for the ſame? Even to that God who knows all his Thoughts and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning this or any other matter, who will reprove and ſet the things he hath done in order before him; even from the Time he had the Beginning of the Knowledge of Good and Evil unto the Day of his Death?</p>
               <p>God knows all things, but we know not as God knoweth; and therefore we are ſo puzzled and diſtracted in things pertaining to him. He ſeeth all things in Heaven and Earth and under the Earth at one Sight, and knoweth all things to the utmoſt as they are known. But we now ſee one thing and then another, in order and Succeſſion of Time, as he ſhews them unto us. Thoſe Things which are more hidden and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he reveals them by his Word and Spirit; and ſtill we know nothing perfectly and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſively. And it may be all confined to things pertaining to us Men, which is not the Ten Thouſandth Part of the things to be known, nor yet one Half of what doth immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto and concern us. The Sum and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of all is to know God and his Law, our Duty to him in each particular, and when we do vary from it.</p>
               <p>It may be obſerved that the whole Scripture (which is called the Lord's Book) may be all reduced to this. Beſides the natural imprinted Knowledge, God is there more diſcoverd to us, by the Hiſtory of the Creation of the World, his Manifeſtations unto his Servants
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102492:57"/> that worſhipped and feared him, his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Works that he did from Time to Time, the Deſcriptions given of him in ſundry Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and alſo the Commandments enjoyned to the Sons of Men. The Law was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> unto which he added much Exhortation to the Obſervance thereof: So did <hi>David</hi> and the Prophets, whoſe Writings were to preſs People unto Obedience and a Reproof of Tranſgreſſion. Which laſt was an orderly Declaration of Matter of Fact and according to Truth how People did turn aſide from the Commandments delivered unto them. It was a Telling of or Declaration unto the Houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> their Sins and Tranſgreſſions. Which was expreſſed in general or more particular Terms; but yet ſo plainly that every Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might underſtand himſelf was ſpoken of and called upon for to amend his Doings.</p>
               <p>There is a ſtrong Senſe and Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heart of Man to keep the Law of his Creator; and he is ſenſible of as much every Time he is put in Remembrance thereof. As on the other hand, he is troubled with Shame, Regret and Condemnation when he thinks of, and more eſpecially when he is told of his Sin and Error. This proceeds from the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of having offended God, and from the Fear of his Anger and Judgment.</p>
               <p>A ſecret Thought doth ariſe from Ignorance or Unbelief, that either God doth not ſee or not take notice of ſuch evil Deeds and will not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102492:58"/> require for them: But ſuch an one brings their Sin to Remembrance and makes it recorded before God; which otherwiſe might fall to the Ground and be forgotten by him. Hence hath aroſe that Hatred and unkind Uſage to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Miniſters and Servants of God for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of and reproving the People of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generations of their Sin and Diſobedience. This alone did put ſome Check and Stop to Tranſgreſſion, and ſo the leſs was committed, and conſequently there was leſs to account for before God. But in thoſe Ages when all Fleſh had corrupted its Way upon Earth, and there was none to oppoſe the Torrent of Iniquity; yet God, who ſits above, both ſaw and knew the whole Courſe of Tranſgreſſion, all one as if Ten Thouſand of his Saints did cry aloud againſt it. This will be clearly manifeſted at the Day of Judgment, when God will diſcloſe and make known the ſeveral Steps and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Irreligion and Wickedneſs, both of Generations and ſingle Perſons, of Countries and Families, whereof we knew and heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. When the Lord ſhall write and rehearſe up all things as they were done from the Beginning of the World. The Sin of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> is written with a Pen of Iron, and graven with the Point of a Diamond; and ſo it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains before God although no Man ever ſpoke thereof by Word of Mouth, or committed it to Ink and Paper. It may be, that the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Acts are willingly forgotten by the Perſons
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102492:58"/> who committed the ſame, but God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them to the impenitent and hard of Heart; and he will renew the Memory of them to the Sinner's own Mind and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. As the Sinner doth now act and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the ſame, he doth treaſure up unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God, who will render unto every Man according to his Deeds, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5, 6. whether good or evil, as is expreſſed in the following Verſes.</p>
               <p>Here again it appears, that the ſeveral Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Life will come into judgment and Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution ſhall be made to the Perſon according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So that in how many things he doth well he will be accepted, and himſelf would have notice taken thereof. If he ſin, that alſo lies at the Door: Which will paſs either into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination and Condemnation, or the utmoſt to be hoped thereof is Pardon and Forgiveneſs, that God would not remember, or not impute it. But this is certain, for the Scripture affirms poſitively thereof, that many ſhall be actually puniſhed for the ſame. For, <hi>Thoſe that have done Iniquity ſhall be cast into a Furnace of Fire,</hi> Mat. 13. 41, 42. and <hi>They that have done evil ſhall ariſe unto the Reſurrection of Damnation,</hi> John 5. 29. yet of thoſe who eſcape by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they certainly ſuffer this Loſs. It would be better for them throughout all Eternity if they had never committed ſuch Acts of Sin Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that the Time wherein they committed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102492:59"/> Iniquity might have been ſpent in well-doing; and ſo they are deprived of the Recompence they might have had for that. Though a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do evil an hundred Times and his Days be prolonged, yet it ſhall be well with them that fear the Lord, that fear before him. Both Manner of Ways will come into account, and they will have a different End. It will be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly better for them who lived in Obedience and Holineſs in thoſe Days of their Fleſh, wherein others did, and themſelves might have lived in Sin and Wickedneſs. That Son who ſaid to his Father, <hi>Lo, theſe many Years do I ſerve thee; neither tranſgreſſed I at any time thy Commandment, his Father anſwered him, Son, Thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine,</hi> Luk. 15. 29, 31. which was a larger and much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Portion and Proviſion than what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or afterwards given unto the prodigal and diſobedient Son. Again, though a Sinner ſhould come to Repentance, yet the ſooner he doth, it will be certainly better for him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will be more ſure of God's Favour and Acceptation; and alſo he will ſooner bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance, and make a Way for his own Reward; whereas <hi>All his former Days were conſumed in Vanity and Trouble,</hi> Pſal. 78. 33, They will not turn to good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; neither doth he deſire that they ſhould come into Judgment; for it will ſtand in no ſtead and turn to no Benefit unto him; but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Anguiſh and Bitterneſs of Soul, that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102492:59"/> he did not in thoſe Days ſerve the Lord in Righteouſneſs, Holineſs and doing good. For theſe Works would follow him, when the other things are abſolutely periſhed, and he wiſhes that he had never done them.</p>
               <p>Here is a real Argument not to continue in Sin one Moment longer; for notwithſtanding the preſent Pleaſure and Conveniency, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he miſſes of ſo much more Happineſs and Advantage. Again, he ſhould not a Minute longer neglect Obedience and doing good, for he loſes ſo much of a full Reward.</p>
               <p>Thus much is ſignified from the Words, of the <hi>righteous Judgment of God who will render to every one according to his Deeds. And ſo it is written, Bleſsed are ye when Men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil against you falſely for my ſake: rejoyce and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad, for great is your Reward in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5. 11, 12, <hi>For the Son of Man ſhall come in the Glory of his Father with his Angels, and then he ſhall reward every Man according to his Works,</hi> Mat. 16. 27. <hi>And every Man ſhall receive his own Reward, according to his own Labour,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 8. <hi>Wo unto their Soul for they have rewarded Evil unto themſelves. Say ye to the Righteous that it ſhall be well with him, For they ſhall eat the Fruit of their Doings. Wo unto the wicked, it ſhall be ill with him: For the Reward of his Hands ſhall be given him,</hi> Iſa. 3. 9, 10, 11. <hi>According to their Deeds, accordingly he will repay, Fury to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, Recompence to his Enemies, to the Iſlands</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:102492:60"/> 
                  <hi>he will repay Recompence,</hi> Iſa. 59. 18. <hi>The great God that formed all things, both rewardeth the Fool and rewardeth Tranſgreſſors,</hi> Prov. 26. 10. <hi>As thou haſt done, it ſhall be done unto thee, thy Reward ſhall return upon thine own Head,</hi> Obad. 15. <hi>Receiving in themſelves that Recompence of their Errour that was meet,</hi> Rom. 1. 27. <hi>Like as the Lord of Host thought to do unto us according to our Ways and according to our Doings, ſo hath he dealt with us,</hi> Zech. 1. 6. <hi>And all the Churches ſhall know that I am he which ſearcheth the Reins and Hearts: And I will give unto every one of you according to your Works,</hi> Rev. 2. 13. There are ſundry other like Places in Scripture, which the more they are conſidered and looked into, they do the more demonſtate the preſent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, how that the future Retribution and Recompence ſhall be proportioned and adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted according to the Deeds of Men, as it will be yet more clearly ſeen at the Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God. It ſhall be openly diſcloſed and ſhewed unto every one. Though it hath been hitherto hidden from ſome becauſe they would not ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for there they might have found it ſo, and accordingly have prepared to have given up their Accounts. The good may be hence quickned to do more, to take hold of every Opportunity, to lay up a greater Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation againſt the Time to come, to ſeek and do the Work of the Lord diligently, and to improve every Talent to the utmoſt: And the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102492:60"/> evil might preſently have ceaſed to do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, turn and be more zealous in the other Way.</p>
               <p>Faith apprehends ſo of things future, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and Recollection is to the paſt. Herein appears the Excellency of the Underſtanding and reaſonable Soul, that ſhe ſees things afar off and remembers thoſe behind. But thoſe things here are ſcarce worth our Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; but what things we are further told of, they are all Wonder and Aſtoniſhment; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo exceeding great and endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Which will fill the Soul though opened wide and to the utmoſt, and ſatisfie every Wiſh and Deſire, and theſe things are always to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. When theſe things ſhall be preſent before us, we ſhall admire and be vexed within our ſelves that we did not more towards the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them. Even thus it will be of thoſe who conſidered and did moſt that uſually Men do. Our Fathers received the Promiſes and ſaw them afar off, they now ſtand more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confirmed unto us, being ſo indubitably made known that we are more fully perſwaded of them, and do embrace them. So the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation runs yet more forcible, to cleanſe our ſelves from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting Holineſs in the Fear of God, and to do all things that we may be found accepted of him at the laſt Day.</p>
               <p>Even thus much we may diſcern at preſent, that the Lord ſitteth above all his Creatures.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102492:61"/> He hath revealed how we the Inhabitants of the Earth are to behave our ſelves towards him. He hath prepared his Seat for Judgment and his Kingdom ruleth over all, neither is any Creature that is not manifeſt in his Sight: But all things are naked and opened unto the Eyes of him with whom we have to do. We cannot know him as he knoweth us, for he ſeeth us and all our Ways clearly; but we now ſee thro' a Glaſs darkly. And as we are mere Creatures, who have nothing but what we have received, ſo we know nothing but what he firſt made known and revealed unto us.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour abode on the Earth Forty Days after his Paſſion on the Croſs and Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Grave, ſpeaking of the things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Kingdom of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 3. ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few of which are recorded. And though many things are written which he made known in the Courſe of. his Miniſtry, yet the beloved Diſciple <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Many other things truly did Jeſus in the Preſence of his Diſciples, which are not written in this Book.</hi> John 20. 30. So before his coming into the World God diſcovered his Will by Prophets, and holy Men ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt. And there have been ſince further Manifeſtations of divine Knowledge and Truth: And yet ſtill the Skies will be more opened and Righteouſneſs ſhall be poured down. <hi>Drop down ye Heavens from above and let the Skies pour down Righteouſneſs: Let the Earth open, and let them bring forth Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:102492:61"/> 
                  <hi>and let Righteouſneſs spring up together, I the Lord have created it,</hi> Iſa. 45. 8. <hi>He ſhall come down like Rain upon the mowen Graſs, as Showers that water the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 72. 6. <hi>Truth ſhall spring out of the Eorth,</hi> Pſal. 85. 11. Both as to the Element it ſelf, and alſo as to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof, <hi>Let the People praiſe thee, O God, let all the People praiſe thee. Then ſhall the Earth yield her Increaſe, and God, even our own God ſhall bleſs us,</hi> Pſal. 67. 5, 6. He ſhall make known thoſe Arts and Means that the Earth ſhall yield her Increaſe ſo abundantly, that there ſhall be no hungry and empty Soul; but there ſhall be more than ſufficient for every Creature whatever. He ſhall give ſuch a plentiful Fleece on the Sheep, and may diſcover thoſe other Ways for cloathing as to cover all the naked in our Land. <hi>Bring ye all the Tithes into the Store-Houſe, that there may be Meat in mine Houſe, and prove me now herewith, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, If I will not open the Windows of Heaven, and pour ye out a Bleſſing that there ſhall not be room enough to receive it,</hi> Mal. 3. 10. Mankind hath been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto proved, wihther they will obey and truſt in their God. The poor hath been a long while ſuffered among them to ſee whether they will will provide for and do them good; and they have not yet been ſo obedient and truſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as they ſhould. But let them once do ſo, let all the People praiſe him, and then prove him whether he will not do thoſe great things for us: Whether he will not deal yet more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102492:62"/> bountifully even in thoſe things, for the ſake of which People now tranſgreſs againſt him. <hi>The Earth is the Lord's and the Fulneſs thereof,</hi> Pſal. 24. 1. The <hi>Silver is mine, and the Gold is mine, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Hag. 2. 8. ſo he can diſcloſe it whenſoever he will, perhaps more than hath been yet ſeen and talked of. <hi>And I will give thee the Treaſures of Darkneſs, and hidden Riches of ſecret Places,</hi> Iſa. 45. 3. He can ſhew us where are the ſeveral rich Mines, and ſome way bring to our Knowledge whatever Worth and Excellency lies hid at preſent in the Bowels of the Earth. So there may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, yea and abundance for all. And there may be ſuch exceeding Plenty, even of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly beloved Mammon, that they ſhall even loath and not eſteem it, becauſe there is no ſuch intrinſick Goodneſs in it as was ſuppoſed. And things will be as readily done without, as heretofore they were greedy and eager after it. The Nature and End of every thing relating to us ſhall be perfectly underſtood, and how they conduce to our real Good and Happineſs. As things ſhall be fully made known which tend to the Uſe, Well-being and Delight of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; ſo the ſame will be diſcerned concerning the Soul. The hidden Man of the Heart will come forth, and as that even now doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear in the Sight of God, ſo it will be yet more manifeſted to our View, that we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo know what is in Man as we ſee his outward Face. The Thoughts of many Hearts ſhall be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102492:62"/> revealed, ſo we may as evidently perceive them, as we behold the working of their Hands, or their goings up and down upon bodily Feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord ſaith, behold, all Souls are mine,</hi> Ezek. 18. 4. He challengeth a peculiar Property in them; and yet he hath ſent forth a peremptory De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth it ſhall die.</hi> The Soul hath a Knowledge of this which cannot be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off; ſo imprinted, that though it may be ſomewhat defaced, yet it cannot be worn out. The Deſire and Tendency riſeth up to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which we ſee not, but yet know, believe and hear of. There is a Conſciouſneſs of Duty to one above, all one as the Servant hath to his Maſter; and as there do ariſe Joy and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when his Duty is rightly performed, ſo there is Regret and Condemnation when it is neglected. There muſt be ſome Thought or a ſtupid Forgetfulneſs; and even for that there is ſome Imagination or ſecret Excuſe. But if that is diſtruſted, as it may; for God will not allow of any Diſpenſation from not ſerving him, and there cannot be any thing more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to a Man or Woman, than how to ſecure his or her own eternal Welfare: So Negligence is the certain Way to miſcarry, and ſo ſink into eternal and remedileſs Miſery. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Soul is ſtirred to ariſe up and be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. She muſt forecaſt and look out how to ſecure her ſelf in this moſt important Concern.</p>
               <p>And when ſhe is put upon thinking and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is one above who doth ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102492:63"/> all her Motions. Who offers to aſſiſt and guide her; who cauſes her to know the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Thought and Imagination. The firſt apprehends a thing really as it is; but the other is hood-wink'd by Deluſion and Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and conceives things otherwiſe than they are. This imagines too much in earthly things, and too little in heavenly.</p>
               <p>In all the Circle and Amuſement of Mind, there is one who would bring us out. In all the Ignorance and Perplexity of Soul, we might at length come to Knowledge and Aſſurance. As we are confounded and diſtracted in the things below, we might lift up our Ears and hearken unto him that now ſpeaketh from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>This is Life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Christ whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> John 17. 3. The ſame God who gave us a Being here, and lent us a ſhort Time on Earth, hath prepared and ordained the other alſo, and told us what we may do that we may lay hold of it. All our Knowledge is to be derived from this Beginning, from the Creator who is moſt worthy, we may deſcend down to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And becauſe many things hinder, darken and obſcure this Knowledge, we are therefore to take heed of and avoid them. <hi>Casting down Imaginations and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf against the Knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Oebdience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 5. God and Chriſt diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every Thought and Imagination as plainly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102492:63"/> as if they were wrote upon Tables of Stone; and when theſe Imaginations are brought forth and ſpread before the Faces of thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, they fall of themſelves, and eve-Thought ſubmits to the Obedience of Chriſt, as the former Diſobedience is laid open and the Unreaſonableneſs thereof is ſhewed.</p>
               <p>What is that <hi>high thing</hi> which exalteth it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God? If it be truly examined it will be brought low. Can any thing be higher than the moſt high? Or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than him who made and comprehendeth all things? Yet there doth lie in the Heart of Man a moſt abſurd, ſtrange and falſe Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it as it were a condeſcending to him to know and ſeek after his Maker. <hi>The wicked through the Pride of his Countenance will not ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God,</hi> Pſal. 10. 4. He is already high and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in his own Eſteem, and he would not loſe ought from that; but if he ſhould once have a true Underſtanding and ſpiritual Light of God, he would <hi>Repent and abhor himſelf in Duſt and Aſhes,</hi> Job. 42. 5, 6. It would utterly take off from the Conceit of his own Excellency. God is moſt worthy of our Knowledge, ſo of Honour, Glory and Praiſe; for he hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things, and for his Pleaſure they are and were created. Alſo our ſelves were made by him, and endued by him with Power and Capacity to know even inferiour things; and by them we ſhould aſcend up to him who is all in all. If any thing is worth knowing, he doth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102492:64"/> infinitely exceed even in that Reſpect, for which ſuch a thing is to be known. And he further contains in himſelf thoſe innumerable Excellencies and Perfections, a little Part and Shadow whereof is ſcattered up and down in the ſeveral Creatures. The more we know God, the leſs we eſteem of all other things; for they come ſo exceeding ſhort of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Greatneſs and Glory that in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of him they are meer Vanity and leſs than nothing. Indeed thoſe who are alienated from the Life of God, who have no Senſe nor Apprehenſion of him, may be like thoſe in a low Dungeon, or a dark Room, where is no Beam of Light; and ſuch may eſteem the ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Glow-worm or the dim burning of a Candle before the Sun which they never ſaw. And ſo are all the fantaſtick Apprehenſions or Conceits of the things before us, ſeparated from Faith and the Knowledge of God. Then he may think himſelf his own, the chiefeſt and moſt lovely in the lower Creation. But if God doth once ſhew himſelf, then all thoſe former Imaginations preſently vaniſh away. If the natural and ungodly Man can but conceive in his Mind concerning the high and lofty one who inhabiteth Eternity. Heaven is his Throne and the Earth his Footſtool, let it be asked, what was it that ever any Man fancied to be higher and greater than this? If the natural Man can but diſcern the Works of God, how that in Wiſdom he made them all, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102492:64"/> alſo Man with a reaſoning and contriving Faculty, how that he eſtabliſhed that Order and Connexion of things which is throughout the World and each Part thereof. How can any Soul conclude any thing pertaining to God to be Fooliſhneſs, only becauſe himſelf doth not clearly apprehend it, when in every thing which he diſcerns ſomewhat more, there alſo he ſees great Wiſdom and Knowledge. <hi>Shall Mortal be more wiſe than his Maker?</hi> Who gave him and all the Generations of Mankind the Knowledge of whatever they ſeem to know. If all thoſe Thoughts of Heart and Conceits of Mind, which have been entertained and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Hearts of the ſeveral Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> were brought forth, as they ſhall be one Day when God ſhall evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſplay himſelf with the very Reality and Truth of things, they will be vaſtly different one from the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Out of</hi> Sion <hi>the Perfection of Beauty, God, hath ſhined,</hi> Pſal. 50. 2. When he makes but a ſmall Appearance of himſelf and we know but in Part, yet then he may be diſcerned to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully great and glorious, what will he be when he ſhall unfold himſelf wholly and then we ſhall know, even alſo as we are known? We ſhall know God as he now knoweth us, and we know one another. <hi>Behold, now we are the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; but we know than when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 John 3. 2.

                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:102492:67"/> We now hear of the Name of God, which is great, wonderful and holy: That is to the outward Ear; but then is a Conception of him in the Mind, and our Eyes are to publiſh forth his Name. We ſee with our very Eyes his Works and the things which his Hand hath made, and by the Dimenſion of them we may <hi>aſcribe Greatneſs unto our God.</hi> He is the ſame ſtill, who abides of old, from everlaſting to everlaſting. He is nothing the more for being publiſhed, nor yet greater for our moſt ample and large Expreſſions concerning him which poſſibly can be ſpoken. Even the holy Men of old have had diminutive and little Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him; which have increaſed yet higher according as more Revelation came into the World, as appears from the Order and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Scripture. They were ſurprized and amazed at the Preſence of his Angel. And what is one of them to Thouſands of Angels? Or what are they to the Lord of all which hath ten thouſand Times ten thouſand miniſtring Spirits before him. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord is a great God, and a great King above all Gods,</hi> Pſal. 95. 3. which Gods may be the Princes of the Earth or Idols. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Among all the wiſe Men of the Nations, and in all their Kingdoms, there is none like unto thee,</hi> Jer. 10. 7. The Prophet, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. declares ſomewhat more, and ſo doth <hi>Daniel</hi> in his ſeventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And yet all theſe come exceeding ſhort of his true Majeſty and Greatneſs. It being
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102492:67"/> ſuch as Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor entred into the Heart of Man to declare God as he is. <hi>I am that I am.</hi> He is known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and by his Name, <hi>I AM.</hi> His only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, who is the eternal <hi>WORD,</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him: And alſo he did before reveal himſelf by his Spirit, but it was by condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto and helping our Infirmities: And therefore the Spirit uſeth ſuch Expreſſions as we can receive, but withal giveth us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the things of God are unutterable; for the Tongue cannot ſpeak forth that which our finite. Underſtandings cannot apprehend, becauſe it is infinite and incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p>But yet ſo far as we know and apprehend we ought to ſet forth the ſame; to the intent that our Children may ſhew forth the ſame unto their Children, and to thoſe which are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born. And God may ſo enlarge their Hearts that they may receive yet further Knowledge of him; what they had from their Forefathers, may grow up yet higher. Obedience is the Follower of Knowledge. <hi>And they that know thy Name, will put their Truſt in thee; for thou Lord, haſt not forſaken them tbat ſeek thee,</hi> Pſal. 9. 10. and ſo it is of all other Duties; and if we may rely on God as to the paſt, where he doth not aſſiſt much further than juſt to perform our Duties, and that alſo through Difficulty and Temptation to exerciſe our Truſt and Dependance on him much more may we do the ſame as to the future, when we verily know
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102492:68"/> and are aſſured that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him. The things prepared for thoſe that wait for him are deſcribed to be more and greater than Eye hath ſeen, Ear hath heard, or hath entred into the Heart of Man, ſo that the greater Apprehenſion and more full Aſſurance we have of theſe things, we alſo are the more quickned and ſtirred up to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our God requires of us in the mean while.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saith</hi> David, <hi>I will run the way of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments when thou ſhalt enlarge my Heart,</hi> Pſal. 119. 32. which denotes Freedom and Speed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will,</hi> that is his own Act. <hi>Run,</hi> doth ſhut out all Delay and putting it off, for it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begins and purſues it with Strength and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. The Word <hi>Enlarge,</hi> doth alſo ſignifie in the Original to perſwade. <hi>God ſhall enlarge</hi> (in the Margent it is <hi>perſwade</hi>) <hi>Japheth,</hi> Gen. 4. 27. for the Apprehenſion of thoſe great things do incline and weigh down the Mind. As before there was an high thing which did exalt it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God, which was only a wrong Imagination, but now there comes a real higher thing, which leads and invites unto his Knowledge, which is ſtronger and doth prevail. In the Margent of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. It is <hi>Reaſonings</hi> oppoſite to the VVord <hi>Imaginations</hi> in the Text: For let Men once come to this and the things of God will outreaſon with them. People may ſit down and ſtop under a ſudden and falſe Thought, or be held under Frowardneſs, Humour and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102492:68"/> or only examine one Side, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeeming Pleaſure and Advantage. But if they would give their Thoughts full Scope, and ſtay a little to ſee whether Truth will come in, reflect whether in this he is not under the Command and Direction of the great Lord over all, and then conſult with his VVord and Spirit; Take in the Conſideration of future Judgment and Account, when there ſhall be an exact Retribution to every Man according to his VVorks and the Matter of this or that Day ſhall be particularly diſcuſſed. The more theſe things are underſtood and conſidered of, they preſs yet more forcibly; and what were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore rebellious and ſuppoſed to be in the Man's own Power, do fall and ſubmit by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, till every Thought is brought into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity unto the Obedience of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Soul is firſt brought unto Obedience in the General, and then the ſame Reaſon which brings in ſome Thoughts, doth the other alſo, till the whole doth come in and yield Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to it. For the ſame God and Father, who is in all and above all and through all, he doth require to be loved with all the Heart, with all the Soul, with all the Strength and with all the Mind. The ſame Lord Jeſus Chriſt expects that we <hi>obſerve all things whatſoever he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> Mat. 28. 20. And ſo whether this ſhall be done preſently or hereafter, there are ſo many Conſiderations for the preſent Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ſame, that whoſo ſuffers them to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102492:69"/> be debated in his Mind, they forthwith turn the Scale againſt all dilatory Pleas and Excuſes. For ſeeing we muſt all appear before God to give Account of our ſeveral Perſons before him, let our ſelves judge this one thing in the mean while, whether God will not be better pleaſed with and ſooner accept of thoſe who make no tarrying to turn unto the Lord, and who do not put it off from Day to Day; or with them who trifle with and deſpiſe him in the mean time. Or whether it will not be better for them whilſt Time is before them and Opportunity is preſent, ſo to employ that Opportunity in doing thoſe things whereof is Hope and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to which God hath annexed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and a Reward. Or to be ſtill running af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe things whereof they are aſhamed in the Act; which heighthens their Doubt and Fear of the divine Threatning and Puniſhment, which is eſtabliſhed by the ſame Word and Truth as the other. So they are either ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding towards Good, or procuring Loſs and Evil to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Every one Deſires good to himſelf and would avoid evil, Hurt and Inconveniency. As he is a Man of Underſtanding and Prudence to let him Judge and do according to the moſt likely Way to obtain the one and avoid the other. See, <hi>I have ſet before thee this Day Life and Good, and Death and Evil: I call Heaven and Earth to record this Day against you, that I have ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you Life and Death, Bleſſing and Curſing:</hi>

               <head>CHAP. III. That Surmiſe and Imagination is ſpoken unto, whereby ſome People think that they have ſo grievouſly offended God that they dare not come unto him.</head>
               <p>THe ſecond Hindrance which keeps People off and was propoſed to be ſpoken unto in the Beginning of this Book, is, that ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they have ſo grievouſly offended God that they dare not come unto him.</p>
               <p>The firſt Example of this we have in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam. And the Lord God called unto</hi> Adam <hi>and ſaid unto him, where art thou? And he ſaid, I heard thy Voice in the Garden, and I was afraid, becauſe I was naked and I hid myſelf,</hi> Gen. 3. 9, 10. A Conſciouſneſs of his Guilt and Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience did make him keep off, yea, and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to approach unto God when he was called. Perhaps he thought that God knew not his Tranſgreſſion, but would diſcern it by ſome outward Sign when he came ſomewhat nearer.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102492:70"/> VVhereas God both ſaw and heard them talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Tree in the midſt of the Garden, and did more clearly diſcern their Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Sin than he could inquire and be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med afterwards. But he came and would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the matter after the Manner of Men. Both to vindicate his Juſtice, and alſo to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that he yet continued his Grace and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity to our Nature: For even in the Curſe and Puniſhment pronounced Mercy is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed. A moſt precious Promiſe is conveyed into what may ſeem a terrible Sentence. <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy Head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his Heel,</hi> Gen. 3. 15. Thus Mercy rejoyceth againſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and even overcometh it at laſt. And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>I will greatly multiply thy Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and thy Conception. In Sorrow ſhalt thou eat of it all the Days of thy Life,</hi> Verſ. 16, 17. Here alſo is ſomewhat releaſed of the pronounced Puniſhment; for God, who is ſovereign, doth not execute in ſo ſevere a Degree as his VVords did ſeem at firſt to import, for though indeed there is Trouble, Pain and Sorrow in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into and Continuance in this VVorld; yet bleſſed be God, it is not altogether ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually grievous as what might have been expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted when the VVords firſt proceeded forth. Thus is the Lord merciful and gracious, even when he is righteous and juſt: And as his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is over all his VVorks, ſo it comes in as a Balm to mollifie his Vengeance. God firſt calls upon our ſinful Parents to ſhew that he
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102492:71"/> had not quite caſt them off, and that they ſhould not languiſh under a perpetual Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their Maker. He finds out a Method of Reconciliation and Accommodation: Tho' withal he ordained them and us a Puniſhment, yet we may truly ſay, the Lord hath puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us leſs than our Iniquities do deſerve. Hence we may learn and be encouraged that if we have not heretofore obeyed the Voice of his Commandment, yet ſtill we ought to come when he calleth us; and it ſhall not be worſe but better for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, behold I frame evil againſt you, and deviſe a Device: Return ye now every one from his evil Way, and make your Ways and your Doings good. And they ſaid, there is no Hope, but we will walk after our own Devices, and we will every one do the Imagination of his evil Heart,</hi> Jer. 18. 11, 12. VVhen People have committed much already, their Conſcience is accuſed of Sin; and they are ſenſible how that they are obnoxious to God's VVrath and Puniſhment; and fearing they ſhall one Day ſuffer under it, they think it the ſame if they ſuffer for much as for little, and ſo they fall from one VVick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs to another. Nay, with ſome there is a moſt ſtrange and horrid Imagination, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors and ſuch like, who conceiving an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and Enmity againſt God, but dreading withal he will be ſtronger than they when they come to meet him; and therefore they take Advantage in this Time of Trial and Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102492:71"/> as it were out of foregoing Revenge to act ſtubbornly, rebelliouſly and contemptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt him as eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> they can. It is written in the <hi>Revelations</hi> of thoſe who <hi>gnawed their Tongues for Pain, and blasphemed the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; becauſe of their Pains and Sores, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not of their Deeds,</hi> Rev. 16. 10, 11. Some again did give Glory to God for his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The firſt Sort, whilſt they were yet in the VVay, did provoke him yet more, who at length was too hard for them and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them over unto the Tormentors. Like as we have known or heard of ſome deſperate condemned Rebels, who might have their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don if they would ſue and make Supplication for it, but they would not through Stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or a pretended Bravery, and therefore they did all the Miſchief they could before they died. In this Caſe the more uſual VVay is to try all Means to obtain a Reprieve or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs; and if that cannot poſſibly be had, then indeed the former Reſolution was the more excuſable. But if it might have been obtained unleſs for ſuch provoing Attempts, or they would uſe them of ſet Purpoſe, here it is the very Heighth of Folly and Madneſs. For they wilfully bring upon themſelves ſuch Evil and Miſery under which they ſmart, only for a ſlight and ſudden Humour which ſoon paſſeth away, and for which they are condemned by all underſtanding Men. Thus it is as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Offences between Man and Man: But yet
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102492:72"/> it is ten Thouſand times more unreaſonable as to Sins againſt God. For, do we provoke the Lord to Jealouſie? Are we ſtronger than he? If any are perverſly reſolved againſt him, they will ſee and feel, who will repent of it firſt, God or themſelves. <hi>The Lord will not spare him, but then the Anger of the Lord and his Jealouſie ſhall ſmoak against that Man, and all the Curſes that are written in this Book ſhall lie upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his Name from under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Deut. 29. 20. All this may be done at this preſent time, even when he knows not or is not ſenſible thereof. But now it would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if he were ſenſible of as much, becauſe then he might fear and tremble, ſubmit, and then endeavour to be reconciled unto him; in the mean while, <hi>Lay hold of his Strength and make Peace with him, who ſaith, Fury is not in me,</hi> Iſa. 27. 4. But if this be neglected, what will the poor Creature do when the Anger and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the Lord which before did ſmoak to give VVarning, ſhall burn out with fiery Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to conſume the Adverſaries when all the Curſes that are written in this Book, and now lie againſt him ſhall be actually executed upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For behold the Day cometh that ſhall burn as an Oven, and all the Proud</hi> (ſuch as will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in the mean while) yea, <hi>and all that do wickedly ſhall be Stubble, and the Day that cometh ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of Hosts, that it ſhall not leave them Root nor Branch,</hi> Mal. 4. 1.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102492:72"/> Let them at preſent he never ſo great in their own Opinion or many for Number: Yet when the Earth and all the Works thereof ſhall be burnt up, they ſhall be likewiſe devoured in the general Conflagration. What is a ſingle Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherd to ſtand before him when he ſhall ſweep away with one Beeſome of Deſtruction all the Generations of the wicked ſince the World began? <hi>Thou carrieſt them away as with a Flood, they are as aſleep,</hi> Pſal. 40. 5. Thus we evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive of thoſe Generations, whereof one cometh, another goeth, and the ſingle Perſons flouriſh and grow up again. They are cut down at any Time, or wither. And in the mean time, <hi>By thy Wrath are we troubled,</hi> Verſ. 7. It is now revealed from Heaven. We now and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome Glimpſes thereof, and we do ſtartle and fear. Thoſe who are fartheſt off and moſt exempted from this Wrath, yet they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have moſt Thought and Apprehenſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. As again, to whom it is moſt due and threatned by reaſon of their evil Deeds, they do what they can to ſhut out the Senſe and Knowledge thereof. For otherwiſe it would preſs in ſo hard and cloſe upon them that then they muſt not continue in Sin.</p>
               <p>Even in thoſe who fence and harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt, yet ever and anon a ſudden Flaſh of divine Vengeance darts into their Minds, which ſtrikes them with Dread and Horror, and by the trembling and Aſtoniſhment it gives, it doth ſufficiently convince, there is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102492:73"/> one mightier than they. Our God indeed now keeps Silence, and is out of Sight, as alſo he forbears in this Time of Tryal, yet he hath declared and made known, that he is <hi>angry with the wicked every Day,</hi> Pſal. 7. 11. who again Day by Day tranſgreſs againſt him: For they ſpeak and do thoſe things againſt God, which they dare not do againſt their fellow-Creature. But when Man hath finiſhed his Time of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Number of the Days of Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are accompliſhed, and God comes to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them altogether. <hi>For the Deſtruction of the Tranſgreſſors and of the Sinners ſhall be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Iſa. 1. 28. Then whatever he thought or did as concerning this almighty Judge, when the things concerning him have an End, then the moſt mad and prophane Wretch that ever trod on the Earth, will be forced to take up <hi>Julian</hi>'s Confeſſion and Acknowledgment, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisti Galilee,</hi> and in another Senſe then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpake in. <hi>O Lord, thou art ſtronger than I, and haſt prevailed,</hi> Jer. 20. 7. Why thus much may be clearly diſcerned in the mean while, for let Man conſider himſelf, or who made him; his Fleſh is as Graſs which grows up towards withering: His Breath is in his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, and who breathed it in, he can take it out whenſoever he will. His Strength is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to ſuch a Degree, beyond which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do more: His Stature, bodily Dimenſion, and every thing he hath is limited to ſuch a Size. And certainly he who hath determined
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102492:73"/> him on every Side, hath Power over him. Who made all Men, he can do more to ſuch a ſingle Perſon, than one Man or Thouſands can do to another. There is one Lawgiver who is able to ſave and to deſtroy. As he <hi>doth good,</hi> ſo he can puniſh: He can do both in a greater Degree and more eminent Manner, than any of the Sons of Men can do one to another. Even to the utmoſt that we are capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and to endure, <hi>For as the Heavens are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Earth, ſo are my Ways higher than your Ways, and my Thoughts than your Thoughts,</hi> Iſa. 55. 9. This is brought in to confirm his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Pardon and Acceptation, Verſ. 7. So again is his Puniſhment and Requital. He can contend and be wroth ſo long, even juſt till the Spirits ſhall fail before him, and the Souls which he hath made. Which alſo he can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and continue yet longer to ſuſtain his Vengeance, as long as himſelf is pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the ſame. <hi>His Loving Kindneſs is better than Life,</hi> for it extends yet further; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Power of his Anger is more to be dreaded than Death, for it is even beyond that. Upon all Reſpects God's Diſpleaſure and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment doth exceed Man's Diſpleaſure and Puniſhment, and conſequently it is more to be feared and more Care ought to be taken that it be avoided.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral Actings and Obligations towards God riſe greater and higher than to the beſt and greateſt of Men, for God is more than all.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102492:74"/> So neither is that Rebellion and Contempt to be uſed towards him, which Men will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of from one another. God is greater than Man: Yea; all Nations before him are as the Drop of the Bucket. <hi>He will keep the Feet of his Saints, and the wicked ſhall be ſilent in Darkneſs, for by Strength ſhall no Man prevail. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of the Lord ſhall be broken in Pieces,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 8. Strength may ſometimes prevail againſt the Son of Man who is weak as we are, but yet many times, a wiſe Submiſſion will do more. But neither Strength nor yet further Provocation ſhall in the leaſt prevail againſt God, when true Repentance will always avail and ſtand in ſtead. Remarkable is that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of our Lord and Saviour, <hi>And I ſay unto you my Friends, be not afraid of them that kill the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom you ſhall fear, fear him which after he hath killed, hath Power to caſt into Hell, yea I ſay unto you fear him,</hi> Luke 12. 4, 5. The utmoſt of Mens Malice and Cruelty extends only to this ſhort Time and to this weak Fleſh, and they uſe it accordingly in this their Hour and Power of Darkneſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God ſuffers, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 18. Mens evil Deeds here in the Body, but when they are diſlodged from that he calls them to Judgment and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and he hath the Length of a whole Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for to inflict Vengeance both on Body and Soul for the ſame. Even here we perceive that at the firſt time of ſuffering or when it is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102492:74"/> ſhort, Men may bear up and not ſink under it; but it is not ſo of a long and continued Miſery. But what our God hath threatned is ſuch that if the wicked were Braſs and Iron it would make them ſubmit and yield, much more will it Fleſh and Bone. <hi>Can thine Heart endure, or can thine Hands be ſtrong in the Days that I ſhall deal with thee? I the Lord have spoken it and I will do it,</hi> Ezek. 22. 14. There is none who doth not ſometimes labour under Sorrow and Vexation of Thought, much more muſt they groan under the Worm which ſhall never die, and they can no way be freed from the Senſe and Feeling thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Surely the Wrath of Man ſhall praiſe thee, the Remainder of Wrath ſhalt thou reſtrain,</hi> Pſal. 76. 10. God firſt endued him with Power to rage and to be furious to that Degree he now is; and as before he did not ordain it further, ſo even now he can curb what he hath made. He will ſhorten and make it quite to ceaſe. When their Rage is againſt him, he will put an Hook in their Jaws, and lead them till they ſhall torment, even till they ſhall quite weary them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. There is no good to be done that way. Hear then what the Pſalmiſt ſaith next, <hi>Vow and pay unto the Lord your God: Let all that be round about him bring Preſents unto him that ought to be feared,</hi> Verſ. 11. Submit and be obedient unto him, have a good Mind and ſhew all the good will towards him which you can, now you are a little while in the Way. Draw near and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102492:75"/> be reconciled ye who were ſometimes afar off, and averſe towards him. Let all that former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation be done away and come to the Throne of Grace with Reverence and Godly Fear. <hi>Look diligently leſt any Root of Bitterneſs ſpringing up trouble you:</hi> Leſt there be any Remainder of that which was heretofore in you. Cut it off Root and Branch; for it doth wholly ſpring up from your Sin and Ignorance.</p>
               <p>God is good and the ſame ſtill from everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to everlaſting: Neither doth he alter or change with our ſeveral Apprehenſions or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions concerning him. But by our Sin and Iniquity we made him our Enemy: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs whereof did raiſe a ſlaviſh Fear and Dread. The leſs we did know of him, the leſs we did diſcover of his Goodneſs and Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Children of Men: As again the more we know of him, the more that doth appear forth unto us. When we ſeek diligently and come yet more near unto God, we do as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive Goodneſs, Mercy, Love, Peace and Joy to flow from him, all one as Vertue did proceed forth from the Garment of Chriſt, and all one as we perceive the Heat of the Fire when we make towards it, or when we go abroad in a bright ſhining Day to ſee the Light of the Sun.</p>
               <p>If Man were verily perſwaded of thus much at firſt, he would never depart and go aſtray from his Maker; as when he is truly informed and throughly ſatisfied hereof. He would inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102492:75"/> return unto him. For who is he that deſires not Good and Happineſs, and would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly at firſt go the ready way to it? Indeed with the ſhew and appearance thereof he is preſently turned aſide to tranſgreſſion, and the pleaſures of Sin. But then it is not long before he finds by ſenſible experience, the vanity and vexation thereof at preſent; and he is further forewarned of Deſtruction and Miſery. And then he may alter his ſteps into the way of Peace and Comfort, which leads unto, and ends in Glory and Happineſs. We may taſte and ſee that the Lord is gracious; for we do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently feel and behold with our Eyes, that thus it is now at this preſent time, as to what he doth require of us, and as to what he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. And ſo his promiſes and threatnings of what are further conſequent to the ſame, are confirmed by the Word and Oath of him for whom it is impoſſible to lie.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are enlightened, do clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern all this; and they who come to true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, when they have ſet aſide all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and carnality, and are throughly ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the perverſities of the Spirit; When they <hi>come to themſelves,</hi> Luke 15. 17. and are ſuch as Men ſhould be, They do likewiſe judge that it is ſo as here ſpoken of; for it is evident to their real Senſe and Diſpoſition. Who have experience both of the Way of the Lord, and alſo of the Way of Sin and Satan, They do affirm that the firſt is better. The Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102492:76"/> wherewith Men are drawn over to Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Ungodlineſs, is, that it hath a ſhew of Liberty and Briskneſs: As again, to ſuch the knowledge and fear of the Lord doth ſeem a confinement and dulneſs, and therefore they refuſe and caſt it off. But this is a moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sin and Provocation to turn <hi>Rebel againſt their God.</hi> It is monſtrous and unnatural to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God that formed them and all things. It is moſt deteſtable impiety, and the utmoſt ill-deſerving, to live in no ſenſe of, and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto the Governour of the World. This is infinitely worſe, and more inexcuſable than for Subjects to riſe up in Arms againſt a good and lawful Prince; for Children to be Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and Froward to a kind, good, juſt and wiſe Father; or as is any Action of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Servant againſt the beſt of Maſters. Yet all this proceeds from want of a right knewledge of God, and of a true Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what his Fear is. I ſpeak this to ſhew the Shame and Degeneracy of Mankind. Even thoſe muſt have their Thoughts altered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and lifted up towards him; or he will <hi>raiſe them up to Shame and everlasting Contempt,</hi> and caſt them into a bottomleſs Pit to ſuffer the Vegeance of eternal Fire. In God is firſt contained, and from him is derived eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good and perfect thing; even what is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, or can be further deſired by the Sons of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Lord, the Hope of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>all that forſake thee ſhall</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:102492:76"/> 
                  <hi>be aſhamed, and they that depart from me ſhall be written in the Earth, becauſe they have forſaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters,</hi> Jer. 17. 13. God ſendeth Rain upon the juſt and the unjuſt. He giveth common Mercies promiſcuouſly and indifferently to all, but there is ſomewhat more and greater in being the Hope of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Somewhat is hidden and reſerved there only for thoſe who come unto him; as again, who forſake him miſs thereof. And when this ſhall be opened and actually given, then Shame, Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Anguiſh will poſſeſs thoſe who by their former demerits and provocation have loſt their ſhare and portion in this matter. <hi>They that depart from me ſhall be written in the Earth.</hi> When they have left and gone aſide from him above, they muſt cleave unto and purſue after ſomewhat. And they cannot fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after any thing, but what is in this place where they live. And ſeeing they have choſen the Earth, either the Men or Things therein, let them make the moſt thereof. But what will they do when the Earth and all the Works thereof ſhall be burnt up? When themſelves and others who inhabit here ſhall die. And if they thought themſelves well enough, becauſe tho' the things herein are periſhing, yet themſelves are periſhing likewiſe, and they ſerve for their Time, Nevertheleſs they muſt remain elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, for they have immortal Souls and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Bodies. And what ſhall they do through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Length and Space of Eternity, when
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102492:77"/> all the things wherein they before truſted, are utterly gone and removed from them. Even <hi>the Men of this World, which have their Portion in this Life,</hi> Pſal. 17. 14. might thus know and conclude, As they thought it worth their while to ſecure this Place and Time, who were for getting the beſt and fatteſt things that they might live happily and comfortably, who were for the greateſt and wiſeſt Company in the whole Country of their Abode, they might have looked up and have learned to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thee, <hi>O King of Nations; for as much as among all the wiſe Men of the Earth, and in all their Kingdoms there is none like unto thee.</hi> They might underſtand and ſeek after the Lord, whoſe is not only the Earth but the whole World and all that is therein; for he <hi>made Heaven and Earth and all things. Who whilſt they lived, did bleſs their own Soul,</hi> Pſal. 49. 18. did ſo hug them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Comforts and Conveniencies of this ſhort Time, they might much more hope for and endeavour after the good things of Eternity, and take a more diligent and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Care how themſelves might live bleſſed for ever. They might have further truſted unto him, who (as they experimentally found) <hi>did good, giving them Rain from Heaven, filling their Souls, with Food and Gladneſs: So the Lord will perfect that wich concerneth them,</hi> Pſal. 138. 8. Thoſe periſhing and fading Comforts were an Earneſt and Aſſurance that he would give the true and enduring Happineſs for ſuch who
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102492:77"/> ſhould endeavour to be found worthy for to receive the ſame. <hi>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous Mammon, who will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to your Truſt the true Riches,</hi> Luke 16. 11. As he provided them with the meat which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, which was had by Labour, Dreſſing, and other forgoing Means, and that did preſerve Health and Life for the Time, ſo likewiſe he afforded the Meat which endureth unto everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Life, which alſo was to he had by uſing ſuch Means of Grace. And as many as did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and comply with the Workings of that Grace, they ſhall be crowned and actually inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with the other to which it did tend and grow up.</p>
               <p>As he is the God of the Earth, ſo of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens alſo. And as he hath determined our Dwelling and Abode here for a Space, ſo he will take us up unto the Heavens for evermore. Here we have no continuing City, but now we deſire that which would continue, and that muſt be an heavenly. <hi>Wherefore God is not aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a City,</hi> Heb. 11. 16. which like himſelf muſt remain for ever. He took us out of our Mothers Womb, and doth hold us up from the Cradle unto the Grave. In the mean while he reneweth his Mercies and Preſervation eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Morning, and there is ſtill ſomething more than all this. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord who daily load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us with Benefits, even the God of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He that is our God is the God of Salvation,</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:102492:78"/> 
                  <hi>and unto God the Lord belong the Iſſues from Death,</hi> Pſal. 68. 19, 20. In that Word <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is compriſed more than can be poſſibly had in this World. <hi>Salvation</hi> imports to be free from all Evil, Fear and Danger, which none is in this World. For, conſider of thoſe who are in the moſt ſafe Condition, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo, yet the laſt Enemy waits for them, which is <hi>Death,</hi> and thence is Fear and Doubt. But we have Aſſurance from our God, who brought us into Being, who carrieth us thro' here, who is Lord of Life, and hath Power over Death, that he will give a Riſing and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from that. Now we have the moſt doubtful Apprehenſions concerning Death and the future State. For though on this Earth we are encompaſſed about with Fear, Pit and the Snare, yet we know what is the utmoſt of things here, and what uſually happens unto others: So we are contented and freed from Terror and Amazement. But further on, if we did conſider rightly, we have more Hope and Security from the <hi>Lord being our Hope,</hi> and the God of our Salvation. And there he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares beforehand, that neither he nor we ſhall be aſhamed. For hereby he will do more for us than we can ask or conceive, and we ſhall find it to be infinitely more than we could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and which will make an abundant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for whatever Difficulty, Loſs or Trouble we did ſuſtain in coming to be Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker thereof: And though our God ſhall <hi>cauſe us</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:102492:78"/> 
                  <hi>to inherit high Places,</hi> Iſa. 58. 12. yet we ſhall not be in the leaſt Danger or Suſpicion of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. <hi>Thou ſhalt be far from Terror, for it ſhall not come near thee,</hi> Iſa. 54. 11. We ſhall be more ſtrongly ſecured from every Evil or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and be wholly exempt from the Thought and Apprehenſion thereof, as we ſhall be let in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of all Good and Excellency, ſo the Continuance thereof to everlaſting, that we ſhall never loſe nor be deprived of it, will be made ſo ſure and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unto us, as they are certain of that Moment wherein they have it; or as we are at preſent ſenſible that we live and breath, or that we have what we graſp at this Inſtant. It will be a much ſtronger Aſſurance than any had of the Houſe which he called by his own Name, and continued in his Family for moſt Generations. Here our Bodies are dying, the Timber and Walls do waſte and decay, but as we now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this, ſo there will be the ſame Certainty, that the Houſe in the Heavens is eternal and will never ſink, for the Lord will be its Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and keep it as long as himſelf is God, which is for ever and ever. <hi>But thou art the ſame, and thy Years ſhall have no End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may ſeem ſtrange and new Doctrine to thoſe who were not particularly told of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or did not believe, or did not throughly conſider, but it will be evidently ſet before our Eyes. We ſhall as clearly know, perceive and be throughly made ſenſible thereof as of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102492:79"/> the Life we now live, and of things wherein at preſent we are concerned and acquainted with. We ſhall be equally, yea, and much more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with them as of the things whereof the Men of this World take moſt Thought and Care. Even they who heretofore were ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and indifferent as to heavenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, yet when they ſhall come to diſcern how nearly they did belong to them, and of how much greater Moment they were even as to immediately relate unto their own ſelves, their eternal Happineſs or Miſery, Then will ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the utmoſt Indignation and Anguiſh for their former Neglect or Refuſal. And there will be the moſt earneſt coveting, yea and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even unto Tears for to partake thereof. They ſhall know and ſee that <hi>it is an evil thing and bitter that thou haſt forſaken the Lord, and that my Fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Jer. 2. 19. They were alienated from the Life of God through the Ignorance and Blindneſs that was in them. They did not conceive what God was, though his viſible and ſtanding Works were a continual Witneſs before them. And further, they might have ſought and read out of his Book, and have looked into their own Souls which were made in his Image; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from within her ſelf ſhe could have ſome Apprehenſion of her Maker. Indeed God hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf in all theſe, but yet he might be ſomewhat found out by thoſe who would ſeek and feel after him; but when himſelf ſhall
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102492:79"/> appear oppenly and fully diſcover himſelf in his true Nature, then thoſe ſhall be ſtrangly incenſed and confounded, who heretofore would not receive the Knowledge of him thro' Prejudice and ſtrange Imaginations: For then we would never have carried our ſelves after ſuch a Manner towards him: We would have ſought diligently and enquired after God, and we would have liked to have retained him in our Knowledge. We would have choſen his Fear if we had then apprehended, It was all really ſo, as now we ſee and are fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it is. Why of this you were or might have been truly informed in the Beginning.</p>
               <p>Though in the State of Abſence and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we could not behold God clearly as he was, yet when <hi>the King was afar off,</hi> we could perceive ſo much of his Beauty that we could conclude it to be certainly real and much more than what we did at that Time ſee. For we had then thoſe manifeſt Glimpſes of his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Glory that we might be moſt fully ſatisfied that all was ſo, which did pertain to him. Like as we have heard ſo have we ſeen, and infinitely much more; for not the one Half, nor yet the thouſandth Part was told us. All things are better and greater than the moſt knowing Saint did believe, yea more than the Prophets themſelves who ſearched diligently and enquired after theſe things, could appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. As we believe, ſo have we ſpoken. We now act and Labour if we may attain to them,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102492:80"/> ſo then they will be found much exceeding our utmoſt Knowledge and Labour. Now it is in our ſearching after underſtanding and ſeeking the Knowledge of God as in travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from one Place to another, or in new Roads, there doth every now and then open a freſh and further Proſpect. We paſs over new Ground, and we find ſomething more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm us in the Judgment we had before of this good Land. So if we ſeek for God in his Works, Word, Grace and inward Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he appears to be moſt great, true, good and gracious, worthy to be known and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Indeed we cannot by ſearching find out the Almighty to Perfection, becauſe of that weak, frail, dark and imperfect State we are are now in: We ſhall know more in the firſt Minute after we are diſlodged from this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle than we could attain unto by Prayer, diligent ſeeking and by intenſe thinking all our Life-time before. But ſeeing that God hath now allotted us ſuch a Space on Earth, to <hi>underſtand and ſeek after him,</hi> Pſal. 14. 2. that we may be careful all along to perform exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame, and in ſuch manner as near as we can attain, which implies an actual Endeavour to do it, even ſo as God doth require it of us. <hi>The Deſire of our Soul is to thy Name, and to the Remembrance of thee,</hi> Iſa. 26. 8. So the End and Intention of all our Thoughts, Words and Actions is to be unto his Glory, and to have them ruled and ſquared by his Word. It is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102492:80"/> evident that when Men are as they ſhould be, that is, freed in good Meaſure from Sin and Ignorance, the very Deſire of their Soul riſeth and makes towards God. Which is a moſt ſure and certain Token that he is good and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our Nature, for elſe he could not be deſired by us. There is indeed a Conſciouſneſs of Imperfection and Abſence, ſomewhat more we would have, and to ſomewhat more we would be yet more nearly united. Now God will make up all this to every one of us. He will ſatisfie and repleniſh to the utmoſt (brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and running over) every Deſire. He will triumph and reign before his Saints gloriouſly. For though they did come ſhort of what was expected and required from them, yet God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth they were but Duſt which paſſeth away and cometh not again. Such Occaſions did ſuddenly paſs by and not return again. They were amidſt Temptations and Hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by which they were overtaken and kept off; ſo our God will reſtore ſuch and ſupply what was wanting. Yet himſelf is God and not Man. He lies under no Diſadvantages but will perform every Part of his Covenant to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, that it ſhall be returned to our ſelves with incredible Gladneſs and Rejoycing, <hi>Lo, this is the Lord we have waited for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truly God is good to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>even to ſuch as are of a clean Heart,</hi> Pſal. 73. 1. Thoſe Promiſes and gracious Expreſſions in Scripture, and what the Holy Ghoſt ſaith concerning God, they are
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102492:81"/> penned in a modeſt and leſs Degree, that even the thing may exceed what we were told of; that what was in a little Meaſure reported of, might be found marvellous and extraordinary. So it will be of all things contained in that Book which we are now required to believe, and they are much beyond what Words do expreſs of them. Here it is ſaid ſimply, <hi>God is good to</hi> Iſrael. A plain Aſſertion, but himſelf will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and ſhew particularly, that he is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendently good to his People, both as to what he doth for them at preſent, and what he hath further provided for them. Even what the World are apt to eſteem leſs, I mean thoſe ſpiritual Bleſſings in heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus, which are in Preparation and Order to thoſe great things to come. The ſenſual Man doth taſt and perceive how ſweet and deſirable it is to gratifie the Fleſh which hinders from diſcerning the things of the Spirit. But he that is ſpiritual doth exceedingly reliſh the Knowledg and Meditation of the moſt high; and he doth more eſteem of the Light of God's Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and the Gladneſs which he puts into the Hearts of his People, than what ariſes from the full Enjoyment of Corn and Wine. In a more eſpecial manner, <hi>God is good to ſuch as are of a clean Heart,</hi> that is, when it is cleanſed from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, when it is freed from <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> when it comes out <hi>from among the Pots,</hi> Pſal. 68. 13. when it is lifted up from the Earth, and diſintangled
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102492:81"/> from the Affairs of this Life, then it doth alſo clearly know and perceive the Goodneſs and Loving Kindneſs of the Lord. Thoſe, who were heretofore alienated through wicked Works come to be acquainted with God when once ſuch wicked Works are truly repented of and forſaken. Who were by reaſon of them ſlaviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afraid, but when once they are aſſured of actual Forgiveneſs and Pardon, then they are in Peace. Who were kept off by wrong and falſe Apprehenſions and Prejudices, when they know him truly and certainly, they find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Lovelineſs and Excellency in him. If they ever came to Repentance, they will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſenſible and actually perſwaded of thus much at laſt. But why will they not ſuffer themſelves to know and be aſſured of thus much at firſt? What need of <hi>departing away from our God,</hi> Iſa. 59. 13. when we might abide well with him all the mean while; and if we go away we muſt return again, or be eternally miſerable. Why ſhould we provoke or make him our Enemy, when there is no need of it at all? Is he worthy to be ſought unto at laſt and not at firſt alſo? Though many go aſtray and return, there may be indeed more Joy and Welcom at firſt, yet it will be better with thoſe who continually ſerve God, <hi>Neither tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs they at any Time his Commandment,</hi> or in as few Inſtances as poſſible. <hi>Son thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine,</hi> Luk. 15. 31. The whole and continued Current of God's Favour is upon theſe.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:102492:82"/>
               <p>God will proportion his Reward according to Mens Deeds: <hi>For the Son of Man ſhall come in the Glory of his Father, with his Angels, and then he will reward every Man according to his Work,</hi> Mat. 16. 27. The Labourers in <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. came all as ſoon as they were called. Neither did they ſtand idle a Moment longer, and ſo they received equal with thoſe who bore the Burden and Heat of the Day. But in this Chriſtian Nation none have that Excuſe of not being called or hired. For every one in every Place may come to the Knowledge and Service of God as ſoon as they will. It is unnatural to be unmindful of the Rock that begat thee, and to forget God that formed thee; eſpecially when we more lately ſprung up from him, and the Senſe of him was freſh and perceptible in our tender Years and his new Workmanſhip. So we conclude that it is moſt acceptable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and increaſe that Knowledge which we had from the beginning; to remember and abide continually by the Root from which we ſpring; to be ever mindful that we are Plants of our heavenly Father's planting; to be Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his Vine, to be purged by him, and be growing up in him, till we bring forth Fruit; to derive our Sap and Fatneſs from him, and as we partake thereof from him, ſo to be glad and rejoyce therein, to <hi>hear of the loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord early in the Morning,</hi> my Soul ſhall make her Boaſt thereof and be glad. To recount youthly Experiences of divine Favour
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102492:82"/> wherein is to be had more real and laſting Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction than in all the Vanity and Folly of our firſt Years. How ſweet is it to recollect, <hi>Through thee I have been holden up ever ſince I was born. Thou art he that took me out of my Mother's Womb. My Praiſe ſhall continually be of thee, and ſo it hath ever ſince my Tongue could speak</hi> plain, or I did conceive the Words which I uttered forth. Thou art he with whom I have been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Days of old. That is no Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe Heart is enlarged, and whoſe Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding opened to conceive of the great things of God and Eternity: Whilſt others thought of hungry and inſipid Recreations, or the ſhort and empty Delights of Sin. His Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was at Liberty to go here and there, but kept off from what would occaſion Wearineſs and haſten Deſtruction. He did glorifie his God thereby and not make it an Inſtrument of Sin unto Iniquity. He did preſerve it in due Health, Strength and Sobriety, by declining thoſe things which naturally bring on Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diſeaſes: And then, by living under the continued Senſe and Apprehenſion of a good God, He is juſt ſo as a reaſonable Creature ſhould be, for he can rejoyce in the God of his Salvation. Be thankful and take Comfort in the things before him. Men may live with the ſame Content and Freedom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Government, as Subjects under a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and an excellent Prince, and Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a good and loving Father.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:102492:83"/>
               <p>God is infinitely and eſſentially good, and alſo loving to Mankind; for he doth actually communicate forth his Benefits unto them. That he is ſo in his own Nature none can deny, nor have the leaſt Doubt. But is he ſo as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to us? Why we taſte and find it ſo. The more any one partakes of the divine Nature and Approaches unto his Likeneſs, he is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out with the more earneſt Deſire of doing good to his Brethren and Fellow-Creatures; and he actually doth the ſame according to the Power and Opportunity put into his Hands. Now this is a manifeſt Token of the infinite Goodneſs of the Godhead, becauſe he hath put ſuch a Spirit and Mind into his Servants to do the very ſame. His Goodneſs doth as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that of the greateſt Saint on Earth, or of that Perſon who was ever moſt beneficial un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, as the whole Sea doth exceed a ſingle Drop. 'Tis God, who doth manifeſt and ſhew forth one Ray of his Goodneſs and Truth through ſuch an individual Creature, and cauſe him to do whatever he doth. Here we are in the Dominion of the Prince of the Power of the Air, even <hi>where Satan's Seat is;</hi> and he doth hinder, or reſiſt, or defeat all the Good he can. His Devices are ſubtle, and his Inſtruments many; ſo he is the Cauſe of all the Evil and Miſery which are ſcattered up and down in the Earth. God ſuffers it to be thus for our Trial and other wiſe Reaſons, that by our overcoming he may have the greater Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102492:83"/> But becauſe of this many are apt to doubt of God's Love to the World. Whereas by this means he doth prove the Children of Men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him: For by their being amidſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and evil, the Trial of their Faith may be had whether they will follow the thing that good is. Whether they will ſtill reſolutely put forth and countermine the Devices of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſo make them of none effect, or cauſe him to fall, and that he ſhall loſe more than he got thereby. God ſuffers many things to come to paſs for our Trial (whereof we are apt to ſtagger concerning his Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Mankind) but thereby he hath ſhewed how they may approve themſelves more than Conquerors, and then he deſigns to crown them with greater Glory and Happineſs. This may be applied to the particular and ſeveral Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations which happen of whatever Kind they be, each may be obſerved by a diſcerning Perſon to exerciſe our Faith and Truſt. <hi>Now for a Seaſon (if need be) ye are in Heavineſs thro' manifold Temptations, that the Trial of your Faith being more precious than of Gold that periſheth might be found unto Praiſe, and Honour, and Glory at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 6, 7. It is irkſome at preſent, and we are apt to have hard and diſtruſtful Thoughts, but this is becauſe we know not all the Reaſons thereof, and how our End ſhall be yet more excellent and happy. <hi>Who led thee through that great and terrible Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, wherein were fiery Serpents and Scorpions</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:102492:84"/> 
                  <hi>and Drought, where there was no Water. Who brought thee forth Water out of the Rock of Flint. who fed thee in the Wilderneſs with Manna which thy Fathers knew not that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter End,</hi> Deut. 8. 15, 16. This will be really found though it be hid from ſome, and they are not ſenſible thereof all along. Indeed this makes the rejoycing more at the End becauſe it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens better than was expected; but yet to know thereof beforehand makes that we <hi>fail not nor be diſcouraged,</hi> Iſa. 42. 5. That we do not grow weary nor faint in our Mind, nor abate one Tittle of our Duty, nor yet deſiſt waiting on the Lord; not to be tempted ſo as to ſay with that profane King, <hi>This Evil is from the Lord, what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer,</hi> 2 Kings 6. 33. but rather to make the contrary and right Concluſion, This Trouble, Oppoſition and Reſiſtance is from Satan the Adverſary, I will endeavour through God's Grace to reſiſt him more vigorouſly until he is bruiſed down under my Feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt tread upon the Lion and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; the young Lion and the Dragon ſhalt thou trample under Feet: becauſe he hath ſet his Love upon me, therefore will I deliver him. I will ſet him on high becauſe he hath known my Name. He ſhall call upon me and I will anſwer him. I will be with him in Trouble, I will deliver him and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him,</hi> Pſal. 91. 14, 15, 16. As long as any one is in God's Way, he is ſafe to carry him
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102492:84"/> through all Difficulty and Danger, that he may overcome and be crowned at the laſt. It is ſaid before, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels Charge over thee to keep thee in all thy Ways,</hi> Pſal. 91. 11. This Promiſe is exceeding particular, and even ſo is the whole Pſalm, for Safety and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation over and from the ſeveral and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Kinds of Evil there-mentioned: So that we may truſt and conclude that by what God hath done hitherto, he will go on to eſtabliſh and finiſh the ſame. <hi>Cast not away therefore your Confidence which hath great Recompence of Reward,</hi> Heb. 11. 35. It is not an haſty nor a fond Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, nor yet a vain Conceit: for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon the whole Truth and Authority of God's Word: which alſo ſpeaks of the Evils and Hardſhips which we meet with in the mean while, which we find to be ſo. That ſame Word doth alſo aſſure us of Strength to hear and go through with, and at laſt of perfect De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and Victory out of them. This is the Favour which the Lord beareth unto his People, until he doth actually viſit them with his Salvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 4.</p>
               <p>But for thoſe who have ſinned with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who have committed Iniquity and done wickedly, how is it with them? Will not the following Verſe give them a Glimpſe of Hope and Comfort? <hi>Our Fathers underſtood not thy Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in</hi> Egypt, <hi>they remembred not the Multitude of thy Mercies, but provoked him at the Sea, even at the Red Sea,</hi> Pſal. 106. 7. If the Queſtion
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102492:85"/> ſhould be asked, wherefore do all Mankind ſin and tranſgreſs againſt the Lord? Have they not a preſent Temptation and Deſire of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good which they imagine God would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them of: Not knowing that God hath provided greater Pleaſure and Happineſs for them, and more Peace and Comfort in the mean while. They are ignorant of this, for otherwiſe they would receive the Good that exceedeth: They do not underſtand the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Multitude of God's Mercies, for then they would not behave themſelves rebelliouſly and contemptuouſly towards him. Like Words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe of <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 17, 18. may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Mankind of paſt Generations, <hi>And now Brethren, I wot that through Ignorance ye ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thus, as did alſo your Father</hi> Adam. A preſent deſire of pleaſure and greatneſsled him into the Tranſgreſſion, and ſo his Sons and Daughters ever ſince have had ſome ſeeming Reaſon why they committed Sin againſt God. To be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced a little more and better from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent imperfect State. Now were they aſſured that what God would do for them, would be beyond all this, then they would endeavour to continue ſtedfaſt in his Covenant. Were they fully aſcertained that they ſhould have greater Good by keeping his Judgments at all times than by declining from or walking contrary unto them, either they would not tranſgreſs at all, or in fewer Inſtances than now they have done.</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:102492:85"/>
               <p>God knoweth all things. As he ſuffers, ſo he doth likewiſe behold the whole courſe of ſinning ever ſince he created Man upon the Earth until this day, with the ſeveral Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, Excuſes, Circumſtances belonging to it; as alſo to what degree of Extenuation or Provocation it might have, and alſo the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Ignorance and Imperfection. He doth not need to be informed thereof, for He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcerns that <hi>Willing Ignorance,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and refuſal of Inſtruction of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>The way of the juſt is uprightneſs, Thou moſt upright doſt weigh the path of the juſt.</hi> Iſa. 26. 7. In like manner he doth conſider all the ways of the wicked, and takes in what meaſure of abomination and evil deſerving is therein; and alſo, how much is to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Satan's Temptation.</p>
               <p>Now the Serpent was more ſubtle than any Beaſt of the Field which the Lord God had made. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. And ſo he continues ſtill to be more cunning than the children of <hi>Eve,</hi> as they are merely ſuch without the aſſiſtances of the Grace and Spirit of God from above, and he befools them. Now again, they might from the Wiſdom and Word of God know his devices, and ſo eſcape, yea, and fruſtrate them. The Lord looketh down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the children of Men, he conſidereth all their ways, and underſtandeth all their works, whither good or evil, with whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth belong to them, to reward, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102492:86"/> or puniſh: He now ſits above, and takes notice of them in order as they are done. But he hath reſerved to himſelf the Power, and appointed a Day to Judge of all, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute unto every one according to his works. This is the alone Prerogative of God above, which he hath kept in his own power: For he alone ſearcheth the heart, and knoweth all things; whereas we do only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a little in a falſe and imperfect manner by doubtful report and miſtaken obſervation. And then we cannot throughly apprehend a thing wherein many are concerned; ſo that we can give no perfect Judgment and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. But the Lord will rehearſe it when he writeth up his people. He hath a Book of all Nations, Families and ſingle Perſons, with the account of time and place they ſtood here on the Earth: as alſo, he notes the things that they have done.</p>
               <p>The Scripture makes frequent mention of this particular ſumming up of our deeds, and that our God doth take regard of them, and will bring every ſecret thing into Judgment, even the moſt hidden paſſages of our Life. <hi>Thou haſt ſet our iniquities before thee, our ſecret ſins in the light of thy countenance,</hi> Pſal. 90. 8. Each ſingle one; for why not one as well as another? nay, every wrong thing and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide, even our errors and miſdeeds, which we paſs over for Inadvertencies and ſmall Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects; thoſe which we ſuddenly act, and do
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102492:86"/> not much mind our ſelves. Thus much is ſignified from what is written, <hi>Who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his errors? Cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults: Keep back thy ſervant alſo from preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous ſins, let them not have dominion over me; Then ſhall I be upright, and I ſhall be innocent from the great tranſgreſſion,</hi> Pſal. 19. 12, 13. Here the ſeveral degrees and diverſities of ſin are ſpecified, by the words <hi>Errors, ſecret Faults, preſumptuous Sins,</hi> and the <hi>great Tranſgreſſion.</hi> A conſciouſneſs that God doth even now ſearch us, and is acquainted with all our ways; and then that we muſt paſs into a ſtrict Examination and Judgment is apt to raiſe doubtful and deſpairing thoughts in our mind. How ſtrange is it that any People ſhould be heedleſs and unconcerned about thoſe things whereof they muſt be called to an account. <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldſt mark iniquities, O Lord, who might ſtand?</hi> And he might do ſo if he pleaſed; but then in his ſight no man living will be juſtified. For no man hath been ſo watchful, circumſpect, and inoffenſive in his Life and Converſation, but hath in ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances tranſgreſſed againſt, or deſpiſed the Lord his God: and as himſelf hath regret and vexation afterwards as he looks back, ſo he would tremble to have them ſet in order before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By thy wrath are we troubled.</hi> Pſal. 90. 7. And again we are comforted, (bleſſed be his Divine Majeſty,) becauſe that ſame word
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102492:87"/> which ſpeaks of God's Diſpleaſure and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt Sin, doth likewiſe aſſure us of his Reconciliation and Pardon. Thereby is to be ſeen a mixture of his Juſtice and Mercy. And it is obſervable, That where are expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons even to terrifie and caſt down, there is ſomewhat cloſe by ſaid to give hope and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and to lift up again; where is Reproof and Threatning, there either commonly goes before, or ſucceeds preſently after, an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to return, and a promiſe of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs So we have the very ſame aſſurance and certainty that God is to be Reconciled unto the World through Jeſus Chriſt, either to the multitude in general, or to ſingle perſons: For God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be ſaved. And he came not to call the Righteous but Sinners to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. This is as evident and clear, as that God was ever angry with the World, or with any ſingle Man for his ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>But this withal is to be conſidered, That if the World will be ſaved in and through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, they muſt in the mean while ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his Scepter and Kingdom, obey his Laws, and obſerve his Sayings. For as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore they have not gave heed unto, nor been governed by them, which hath occaſioned his Wrath and <hi>ſore Diſpleaſure,</hi> Pſal. 2. 5. ſo to avoid that, and obtain his mercy and favour,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102492:87"/> they muſt now do what heretofore they left undone, and ought to have done, and refrain from what they were forbidden, and yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore they did. Leave off all manner of Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedience, and hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward perform all Duty and Service. <hi>Kiſs the Son leſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little. Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi> Pſal. 2. 12. Submit, and be reconciled unto him, leſt you miſs of that Path of Life which he leads in. He knows if you deſpiſe him, and you muſt take him for a Guide and Saviour to follow him whether ſoever he goeth. <hi>For ye were as Sheep going aſtray, but are now returned to the Shepherd and Biſhop of your Souls.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 25. Without this actual Returning and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, there is no Salvation and Mercy.</p>
               <p>If men will not do what is firſt required, it is vain to talk of, or hope for Pardon and Forgiveneſs; if they will not perform the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary foregoing Conditions and Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they have no lot nor ſhare in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; not one good thing doth belong to them; not one <hi>Iota,</hi> or Tittle of God's Mercy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes, and comfortable Truth, is applicable to them until they do indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the work of Repentance. God is not their Father, nor doth he look with an Eye of Goodneſs and Compaſſion upon them till they are indeed returning and coming unto him. And indeed, when one doth really ariſe, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102492:88"/> is coming towards God, then our Heavenly <hi>Father may ſee him yet a great way off, and go out to meet him.</hi> Luke 15. 20. Love and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs are kindled at the very ſame moment when his reſolutions are of going home, and theſe do happily meet together.</p>
               <p>The end of telling People their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing, is becauſe many times they are blinded, and inſenſible of them. Indeed they may know a little ſlightly and confuſedly, but another may better lay the Law before them, and then themſelves may conſider their varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from it. Sometimes they are at a ſtand, and as it were amazed, and they know not what to do; they may firſt ſee, and fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and then <hi>acknowledge,</hi> according to that Example in Ezra 10. 2. <hi>We have treſpaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our God, and have taken ſtrange Wives of the People of the Land; yet now there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing.</hi> So of every Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Tranſgreſſion or Sin, whether it is complicated or ſingle, whether many or few are concerned therein, ſtill there is hope that God will do what he declares, which he alſo will as certainly as he is God. For <hi>he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping Mercy for Thouſands, forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin.</hi> But then they muſt make a Covenant with their God to forſake their ſins for the time to come, and hence forward to <hi>tremble at his Commandments,</hi> and to <hi>do according to the Law.</hi> But if they cover their ſins, if they
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102492:88"/> keep and hold faſt to them, then they are ſtill <hi>guilty,</hi> whom the ſame Truth hath here ſaid, <hi>That he will by no means clear,</hi> Exod. 34. 7. The word Forgiving, reſpects what is paſt, but doth not allow for the preſent or future.</p>
               <p>What then? <hi>Shall we continue in Sin that Grace may abound?</hi> God forbid That God may ſhew the more mercy in our manifold and greater ſins, that we may love much, when much is to us forgiven. But this, and ſuch like, is a perverſe, wicked, proud and diſdainful way of Reaſoning, Becauſe God will forgive, we will ſin yet more; becauſe he is Gracious, therefore we will provoke him; becauſe he is Good, we will preſume to offend him yet more; becauſe he will paſs by the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the remnant of his Heritage, and make it up again, we will break, and at no time continue ſtedfaſt in his Covenant. And knowing that he will paſs it over, we will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Name of the Lord, and hold up our hands to ſtrange Gods; we will idolize and labour to pleaſe Men, without any regard had to him. <hi>Shall not God ſearch this out, for he knows the ſecrets of the heart?</hi> He doth ſee and diſcern all ſuch kind of Imaginations, which ſhoot forth into alike practices.</p>
               <p>We ſhould do well to conſider with our ſelves, Wherefore do we deſire any forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at God's hands? Becauſe we would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his Mercy, and avoid his Wrath. We would be happy, and are unwilling to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102492:89"/> Why, know we not <hi>that the mercy of the Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him; to ſuch as keep his Covenant, and to thoſe that remember his Commandments to do them,</hi> Pſal. 103. 17, 18. <hi>And the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unrighteouſneſs of men,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. and <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> Coloſ. 3. 6. And therefore we muſt fear God if we would partake of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Attribute, and carefully eſchew all the other, that we do not fall under the ſeverity of his Vengeance. <hi>If we would be happy, we muſt be holy; and to prevent miſery, the only way is to ſin not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are but meer Creatures. All that we have is from God; and ſo is all that we expect further. We are but periſhing and imperfect at preſent; and we ſhall be yet ſomewhat more, as our hopes and deſires, our fears and averſations, give us notice of. So that if we would have the good-will and love of God, the conſequent is natural and eaſie, for our ſelves to ſhew love and good-will towards him in the mean while. And then we muſt ſin as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle againſt him as poſſible. <hi>Ye that love the Lord bate evil,</hi> Pſal. 97. 10. And ye are to decline every falſe way: we are to endeavour to ſet forth his glory, and to honour him; which ſhuts out all manner of ſtubbornneſs, and the leaſt deſpiſing of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore, we receiving a kingdom which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be moved, let us have Grace whereby we may</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:102492:89"/> 
                  <hi>ſerve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear,</hi> Heb. 12. 28. We have the Promiſe and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of that Kingdom, and to us is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the mean while, what is preparatory to that. The work and ſervice is given and ſhewed that we may do it: and as we are put in the condition of Servants to ſo great and honourable a Maſter as he is in Heaven, ſo it is required of us that we be faithful and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; that is, true in the management of what is committed unto us, and ready in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the ſame. Another Character that belongs to a Servant, is, That he be Wiſe, whereof our Saviour ſpeaks and promiſes to ſet ſuch over his Houſhold. Accordingly the Apoſtle intimates as much negatively; <hi>See that ye be not unwiſe, but underſtanding what the will of the Lord is,</hi> Eph. 5. 17. This muſt be in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to do the will of the Lord: And alſo, we are to be in a readineſs againſt his time of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to demand an account. By doing of God's Will, we learn to know it better, and the performance is more eaſie; we can correct what was amiſs heretofore, and perform it more exactly for the time to come.</p>
               <p>From the quality of Servants, we come to a more intimate Relation of Sons; which the Scripture to aſſure us of God's Love and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity to Mankind, doth more often make uſe of, than the other compariſon of Servants. <hi>I will ſpare them, as a Man ſpareth his own Son that ſerveth him,</hi> Mal. 3. 17. Now former
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102492:90"/> miſcarriages are paſſed over and forgotten, when there is a ſincere and actual ſervice for the time to come; where there is a conſtant deſire to pleaſe, and be accepted with God. Agreeable hereunto is the ſtile of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and calls to Repentance. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, ſhall they fall and not ariſe; ſhall he turn away and not return? Why is this people of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem ſlidden back by a perpetual back-ſliding? They hold faſt deceit, they refuſe to return,</hi> Jer. 8. 5. But if they do return, they have forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with aſſurance of Pardon and Forgiveneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what is written: <hi>But if the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all my ſtatutes, and do that which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die,</hi> Ezek. 18. 21. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> Iſa. 55. 7.</p>
               <p>There are innumerable Promiſes ſcattered up and down in the Old Teſtament, and alſo in the New, to give hope and encouragement unto ſinners to return unto the Lord their God, which do anſwer all their particular doubts and fears. Whatever be their multitude and aggravation; If they <hi>have played the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot with many lovers, yet return again to me ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 3. 1. Or if their ſins be as <hi>ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> or <hi>crimſon,</hi> of the deepeſt die and guilt, <hi>he will make them white as ſnow,</hi> Iſa. 1. 18. Which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102492:90"/> whiteneſs is an emblem of Innocency; or, whatever harm they have done, <hi>they ſhall be as wool,</hi> which hurts none, but warms and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes. There are abundant Examples which do ratifie and confirm the ſame: God was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten diſpleaſed with his own People the <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> and yet he was appeaſed and reconciled again. The time would fail me to ſpeak of the Harlot <hi>Rahab, Sampſon,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> the Idolatrous King; as alſo, of thoſe who came and confeſſed their deeds, and were baptized of <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan;</hi> of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> whoſe ſins were many, and yet they were forgiven; yea, even the wicked <hi>Jews,</hi> who delivered up our Saviour Chriſt to be Crucified: Yet theſe are called upon to <hi>repent and be converted, that their ſins may be blotted out,</hi> Acts 3. 19. And ſo perſecuting <hi>Saul</hi> obtained Mercy. Theſe things are written not to give licenſe or preſumption to Sin, but who heretofore have ſinned igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly or unadviſedly, they are hereby ſhewed and exhorted to come out quickly, leſt they be <hi>ſwallowed up with over-much ſorrow,</hi> and they ſink under the burthen of their ſins. They may caſt off the burthen of ſin, or get from under it as ſoon as they will.</p>
               <p>It is hard to ſtate and apply thoſe many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Texts in Holy Sccipture in ſuch manner, that on the one hand the Grace of God may not be turned into Laſciviouſneſs, or be a further occaſion of continuance in ſin. ſo on the other hand, that all may be invited, and have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102492:91"/> Hope and Comfort to be Reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
               <p>Many People are apt to think that they have an allowed time of Tranſgreſſion; that they have a ſpace of diſobedience and refuſal of Subjection unto Almighty God, wherein they may walk in their own ways, and according to their own thoughts; yea, and they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry to be intrenched upon, and to be deprived of that. To maintain and keep up this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Privilege, as they imagine it, they are unwilling to hearken and come over im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately unto God: but they do not withal conſider, that God knoweth thoſe and alike thoughts, every imagination in the mind, and alſo thoſe ſudden conceits which are preſently huſhed and ſtopped, but the Man is reſolved to act by them. God diſcerns all theſe, and can point them out by their names, who are for being rebellious, ſetting up of themſelves, and would live without God in the World; and though they will ſubmit at laſt to ſave themſelves, yet God underſtandeth why they would not in the mean time before: And it may be there is ſo much provocation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt therein, that God will not accept of what is offered unto him as a refuſe at laſt; who ſtand out, they may ſtay away, and not come at all. For if you would indeed have the Favour of God, if you have not done it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, you muſt Repent and do his Will: and if when firſt his Will is made known unto
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102492:91"/> you, you have an Averſation and Backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it, you muſt ſhake off that and do it nevertheleſs. So if you make an haſty and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Promiſe to one of God's Servants, or to himſelf immediately, that you will live obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently according to his Word and keep his Commandments; but afterwards you <hi>diſſemble</hi> like thoſe in <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. 20. with him, becauſe they will be out of Sight and Knowledge, or forget and not mind your Vows which you have made to the Almighty; yet he ſits above and alſo ſearches your Heart to ſee and know whatever you do as pertaining to this. Nothing can be hid or concealed from God, who in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Time will manifeſt the Counſels of the Heart, and bring forth the moſt reſerved and ſtrange Imaginations.</p>
               <p>The Prophet did intend ſomewhat alike what is afore-mentioned, when he uſeth that Phraſe and Kind of Words, <hi>Hearken unto me, ye ſtout-hearted that are far from Righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 46. 12. that will not ſubmit as it were out of a Piece of Pride and Bravery, and they do of ſet Purpoſe keep off. <hi>I bring near my Righteouſneſs, it ſhall not be far off, and my Salvation ſhall not tarry,</hi> Verſ. 13. But they will go further off and ſtand more at a Diſtance, and delay the more that they may not ſee it. A Perverſe and contrary Manner of act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng, which God doth behold and will alſo recompence it upon them. There are ſome who let God do what he will, ſend forth his Light and make further Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102492:92"/> of Truth, give more preſſing Motives and Arguments, ſend his ſeveral Sorts of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet they will not return to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ord. And ſo notwithſtanding all his Methods of Mercy and Truth, when there are already great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes brought over and converted, yet they reckon it as it were a greater Piece of Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Honour, that for all that they will not be perſwaded. In that exceeding Glory of the Church by the vaſt Multitude of the Gentiles coming in, yet ſome will ſtill be rebellious, yea, and refuſe to come. And therefore it is, that a Denunciation and Threatning is put as it were juſt in the Middle of all thoſe Bleſſings and Promiſes; <hi>for the Nation and Kingdom that will not ſerve thee ſhall periſh; yea, thoſe Nations ſhall be utterly waſted,</hi> Iſa. 60. 12. If that be their Humour and Reſolution, ſo it may be to <hi>kick againſt the Pricks,</hi> to run their Heads violently againſt a Stone-Wall, to ſet themſelves as it were againſt their God. VVhen he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied and foretold of ſuch an univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, they will, what lieth in them make God a Liar, for themſelves will yet ſtill refuſe to be reformed. O wicked Fools! Poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Souls! This you cannot do, but confirm his Word the more. For his holy Spirit doth foreſee this Stubbornneſs and Refractorineſs of yours, and even ſpeaks of it ſome Thouſands of Years before your ſelves practice it. That the Purpoſe of God might ſtand, and what himſelf hath ſaid ſhall be fulfilled. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102492:92"/> for your evil Intent and Malice of Heart you ſhall ſmart and be puniſhed for the ſame. <hi>They ſhall periſh, yea, and be utterly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted;</hi> and then themſelves ſhall know whether it would not have been better for them to have ſerved God, than (as they did) to have went on in their Perverſneſs and Oppoſition.</p>
               <p>There are two main Ends, the Glory of the great God and the Good of his Creatures. This laſt is dependant and conſequent to the other, and with reſpect to himſelf Man is to reflect all back from whence it firſt came. God doth make thoſe precious Promiſes of good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance unto us. <hi>They ſhall inherit the Land for ever, the Branch of my planting, the Work of my Hands that I may be glorified,</hi> Iſa. 60. 21. Now if any ſhould act ignorantly, out of a ſelfiſh but miſtaken Spirit, conſult only for their own Good and Safety, not thinking ſo much of the Glory of God; This is to alter and tranſverſe his Method, and by their thus doing themſelves will have the leſs Good, if they do not miſs of all. Theſe act unworthily and contemptuouſly. But yet they do much worſe, and are worthy of ſorer Puniſhment, who are not contented to let God alone, but they have a ſecret Purpoſe as it were to diſhonour him. If they think that God may be glorified by ſuch a thing, they will with a ſecret Imagination what lieth in them, croſs that Intent and Purpoſe. VVho will endeavour to diſannul what he hath ſaid, and try to defeat what he hath purpoſed and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102492:93"/> intends to bring to paſs. <hi>Whom God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, they conſult to caſt him down from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. They bleſs with their Mouth, but they curſe inwardly,</hi> Pſal. 62. 4. VVho after the manner of Hypocrites talk of God and his Glory, but at the ſame time they both think otherwiſe in their Hearts, and alſo practiſe contrary in their Actions. God hath vowed to puniſh ſuch Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. He doth firſt defeat and then over-rule their wicked Imaginations and Practices to his own greater Glory. <hi>He that ſitteth in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall laugh, the Lord ſhall have them in Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> Pſal. 2. 4. He doth behold all the cunning Contrivances and Actings of Men towards him. <hi>For the Lord is a God of Knowledge and by him Actions are weighed,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 3. of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Kind they be, whether good or Evil, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they pleaſe or provoke him. He knows with what Heart and Intent each thing is done.</p>
               <p>Strange! That any of the Sons of Men who are but meer Creatures, who are weak and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſubject to Pain here and Miſery hereafter; liable to Death here and Damnation hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo likewiſe they are capable of receiving Good and Happineſs, and theſe come from without or can be manifeſted from within; yet they ſhould not endeavour at all times to behave themſelves rightly towards the great Lord and Diſpoſer of all things in the whole World. All that we have already is from God, and he hath reſerved more which he can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe forth according to his own good Will
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102492:93"/> and Pleaſure. His Favour and loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are moſt worthy to be ſought after, for it gives Peace and Aſſurance at preſent, and is better than Life it ſelf, which doth reliſh and perceive all things, and then tranſmits over to an eternal State of Bleſſedneſs. Who would not partake of this? For even the Deſire and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Senſuality, the Endeavours after being great and highly eſteemed, redounds all to this at laſt, that he may be an happy Man. To be ſo for all Eternity is rather to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, than to be ſo only for a ſhort Time. Nay, an aſſured Hope and Expectation of that is to be preferred before the preſent Pleaſure of Sin; for as every one feels within himſelf, and is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, there is a certain fearful Expectation of the End of that which is Death and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Who will ſhew us any Good?</hi> Pſal. 4. 6. is the Language of every one: Where and how it may be had, is the great Thought and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Heart; yea, and there is an actual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after it where it may be had with ſome little Pains and Labour, as appears by the ſeveral Actions, Ends and Deſigns of Mankind. And though the Generality of the World hath been long ſettled on the Lees, and they do ſtill continue ſo. They are ſunk down into Earthlineſs and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life: And they being wholly taken up with the Conveniences and ſmall periſhing Pleaſures of this Life; they do not care to riſe and aſcend up higher. But yet they would do well to give heed unto thoſe VVorkings and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102492:94"/> Movings of their Soul; for that equally reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es after Happineſs, and covets after ſomewhat which is wanting in order to it, as the Body deſires Food and Health towards Preſervation of its Life here.</p>
               <p>This is only the Time of Trial and State of Preparation. If we can ſhew our ſelves faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and overcome, but all our Acts here are in Order and Tendency to ſomewhat hereafter. They are but Means towards the End, and as a Scaffold towards the building up an Houſe eternal in the Heavens. Nothing here is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and for it ſelf. All we are ſtill paſſing on, and like wayfaring Men, who have a Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but no Abode; who make ſome Stop, but no continued ſitting down. And when we would as it were reſt and fix up our Abode; yet the very Succeſſion, Change, Periſhing and Wearineſs of our Acts teach us thus much. The Times and Seaſons inſtruct us in this; the Four Quarters of the Year, Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter: The conſtant Courſe of Day and Night, alſo Infancy, Childhood, Youth, Manhood and declining Age; the Times of Labour, Recreation, Eating and Drinking; all theſe paſs on. Too many are like Men amazed and aſtonied, they know not what all this means. <hi>They know not, neither will they understand, they walk on in Darkneſs, all the Foundations of the Earth are out of courſe,</hi> Pſal. 82. 5. Though the Light hath ſhined and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted what their End is of being here, and what is required of them, yet they are willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102492:94"/> ignorant, but go on as the reſt do. <hi>This is the Manner of the Inhabitants of the Earth that dwell careleſly, that ſay in their Hearts, We are and none beſides us,</hi> Zeph. 2. 15. There is a ſecret diſowning of God above, or if they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him by a few Acts of outward Worſhip, yet they confine all to that; but they have not to do with him in the common Actions and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Courſe of their Life. Here they conclude that they are left to themſelves, and theſe things they imagine are in their own Power. Some others will have Reſpect unto God in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle trivial Concerns, but for thoſe of greater Moment, they do not take Counſel of him; nor yet are directed by his Law, nor yet do they conſider rightly for his Glory. Were Men verily perſwaded and did they act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, That God is to be obeyed in all things and at all Times; not only in his Preſence in the Sanctuary, but alſo when they are more Apt to forget him at home and abroad, in their going out and coming in. Not only before his Saints and Servants, as <hi>Paul</hi> did intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Philippians,</hi> but alſo when they are abſent and afar off: The Lord's Name is to be praiſed from the riſing of the Sun unto the going down thereof: So in Man's going forth unto his Work and Labour until the Evening. And then we are to lie down in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him, and to riſe up again to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him To think upon him whilſt in Bed and awaking; and as others Deviſe Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their Beds, ſo our ſelves ſhould forecaſt
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102492:95"/> which Way we ſhall moſt ſerve and honour him. If this were univerſally practiſed by all Perſons in all Places, we ſhould ſee another kind of World, than as yet hath been. And do we not think it would be better and more happy with Mankind if they did thus, then as now they do in living ſecurely and negligently.</p>
               <p>The Miſtake and Errour is, that they do not ſee the different and miſerable Effects till it is come upon them. So the Prophet ſaith in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. concerning <hi>Nineveh.</hi> That when ſhe ſhall be deſolate and uninhabited, then Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall reflect and look back upon what hath brought this Judgment on her. And ſo when the World comes to be puniſhed for their Evil and Iniquity, then they ſhall call to remembrance and conſider what brought all this Miſery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. But then it is too late and to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but to aggravate their own Folly, and to torment them yet more. And ſo contrariwiſe, It would have been well with them if they had done after this and that Manner. Why, you were told and warned of as much by the Word of God for whom it was impoſſible to lie. So that they might even then have been aſſured it would as certainly be as now they find it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent upon them. It was neceſſary to be told of it before, becauſe they might have done ſome things for which they ſhould have <hi>been worthy to eſcape,</hi> Luke 21. 36. and alſo obtain Good for which they did labour and endure, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Conditions ſhould be performed; they
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102492:95"/> ſhould be in the mean while rendred meet which the ſame God did preſs unto by the ſame Word and Truth, which ſpoke beforehand of theſe things.</p>
               <p>People are apt to ſtumble and be blinded at the Doings of God. <hi>Our Fathers underſtood not thy Wonders in</hi> Egypt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 7. till after they were over. And ſo it was of their Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings towards his Servants the Prophets, whom they did perſecute unto Death, and afterwards they acknowledged them to have been faithful Meſſengers ſent from God So whilſt the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as lived and dwelt amongſt Men, they doubted whether it was he. But after they had crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and put him to Death, then they underſtood it. <hi>Now when the Centurion and they that were with him, watching Jeſus ſaw the Earthquake, and thoſe things that were done, they feared greatly, ſaying, truly this was the Son of God,</hi> Mat. 27. 54. Now Jeſus did in his Lifetime both by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Miracles, manifeſt ſufficiently before the Jews that he was the holy one ſent from God. <hi>No Man can do thoſe Miracles that thou doſt except God be in him,</hi> John 3. 2. <hi>The Works which the Father hath given me to finiſh, the ſame Works that I do, bear Witneſs of me, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſent me,</hi> John 7. 36. And ſo they were amazed at his Doctrine, for it was with Power, and he taught as one having Authority, and not as the Scribes. It was ſublime and divine, and and ſo they might even then be convinced and apprehend it. Thoſe many, great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102492:96"/> things done throughout the whole Courſe of his Miniſtry, were as evident a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of his being the Son of God, as what appeared afterwards. And when they did oppoſe him continually from Time to Time, and ſtill they were more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his Truth and Divinity, yet ſtill to go on and to the utmoſt Pitch of their Malice and Rage as to kill the Body. And when the whole Time of Trial is over, then to acknowledge that they were in a Fault, and would not have done it; to pretend Ignorance for an Excuſe or Mitigation of their Sin, when it was either <hi>willing Ignorance,</hi> or a falſe Plea, God who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Hearts will judge of all this. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our notably confutes ſuch groſs Hipocrites and Diſſemblers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 29, 30, 31, 32. <hi>Who ſay, if we had been in the Days of our Fathers, we would not have been Partakers with them in the Blood of the Prophets;</hi> when at that very Time they did the ſame againſt Chriſt (whom the moſt moderate Fame did ſay, he was one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets riſen again, but others Chriſt, and others <hi>Elias</hi>) as their Fathers did againſt the Prophets. And ſo it was clearly manifeſted that themſelves did not only allow the Deeds of their Fathers; but themſelves at that Inſtant did the ſame. And as they were Witneſſes againſt themſelves that they were Children of them which killed the Prophets, ſo they did afterwards <hi>fill up the Meaſure of their Fathers,</hi> for they proceeded and did kill him alſo of whom God ſpake to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102492:96"/> 
                  <hi>Moſes, I will raiſe them up a Prophet from among their Brethren like unto thee,</hi> Deut. 18. 18. who was more than all the Prophets, or the Angels, yea the very Chriſt, the anointed one of God.</p>
               <p>This is the Abomination of Hypocriſie, that when they do wickedly againſt God, they would juſtifie themſelves before Men, and make a Shew as if they had not ſinned, nor done cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly. They would firſt hide their Sin as <hi>Adam,</hi> but if it is known as publick Acts are, then they would put a Colour and Pretext to it. But what are your Sins to us, or what are we that ye ſhould plead with or extenuate your ſelves before? Your Sins are againſt the Lord, and he is the Judge himſelf. <hi>Oh let the Wickedneſs of the Wicked came to an End, but eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Juſt: For the righteous God trieth the Hearts and Reins,</hi> Pſal. 7. 9. He obſerves the ſeveral Steps and Gradations thereof. He ſees how far it will go. And it may be, that is one Reaſon why he ſuffers it to proceed ſo far, that the Folly thereof may be more manifeſt, that Sin may appear to be exceeding ſinful; that when he comes to diſſect and lay it open with his eternal Truth, we may ſee the infinite Guilt and Aggravation thereof. Like a putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Sore, which the longer it is let alone, the worſe it grows.</p>
               <p>If God ſhould ariſe in his Anger and lift up himſelf, Evil and Tranſgreſſion could never have proceeded ſo far as now it hath done. If God had ſpread out his Light univerſally to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102492:97"/> reprove the Deeds of Mankind, there had not been ſo much Sin and Ungodlineſs. If his Truth were clearly, univerſally and fully made known, it would prevent a great deal of Sin and Errour. Neither then had all Fleſh cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted its Way upon Earth as now it hath done. But there hath been the <hi>Hour of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Power of Darkneſs,</hi> Luke 22. 53. In which things have been ſuffered ſo to be. That Hour draws towards its End, and the Light doth begin to ſhine. Then alſo Sin and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity will have its Period. It will make an End of Tranſgreſſion and bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs. <hi>For he will finiſh the Work and cut it ſhort in Righteouſneſs, becauſe a ſhort Work will the Lord make upon the Earth,</hi> Rom. 9. 28. What hath been ſome Thouſand Years in Agitation and Continuance, may be brought to an utter End within the Compaſs of a Year or leſs. Even as we ſee, that he who hath been a Sinner all his Life long, is converted in an Hour or a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute. By one full and clear Conviction of the exceeding Evil and Danger of Sin, he may be induced and brought over imediately to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it. If we were throughly made ſenſible of the infinite Goodneſs and Glory of God, and how he is diſhonoured by the breaking of his Law, this alone Conſideration ſhould move any one, who hath the common Senſe and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, to refrain from Tranſgreſſion. If we did ſee after the Manner of Men, from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of an enraged Prince who hath the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102492:97"/> to be revenged on ungrateful Rebels, and is conſtant to what he ſwears or ſaith: <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day; if he turn not, he will whet his Sword, he hath bent his Bow and made it ready,</hi> Pſal. 7. 11, 12. He is more and more diſpleaſed day by day; and as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture continually provokes him, God only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears to execute his Vengeance, to ſee whether he will turn or not. The longer man puts it off, it will be worſe for him: How grievous and abominable is it to ſtand, as it were, at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance and oppoſition with God? For a worm to conteſt with, and to wriggle againſt its Maker; for a Potſherd to ſtrive with the Lord of the World. He juſtly declares himſelf to be an Enemy to ſuch wicked doers. <hi>Ah! I will eaſe me of mine Adverſaries, and avenge me of mine Enemies,</hi> Iſa. 1. 24. He only ſends out his Word to give notice thereof to ſee if they will ſubmit. He ſends out the Son of his Love with an Offer of Reconciliation, to prove whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will receive his Meſſage and Counſel, who ſaith, <hi>Agree with thine Adverſary quickly, leaſt the Adverſary deliver thee to the Judge, and the Judge deliver thee to the Officer, and thou be caſt into Priſon: Verily, thou ſhalt not come out thence till thou haſt paid the utmoſt Farthing,</hi> Mat. 5. 25, 26. The more quickly thou agreeſt with thine Adverſary, the more ſure thou art to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto him. Thou muſt be reconciled to him firſt or laſt, or thou wilt be eternally mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. The longer thou ſtandeſt off, thou
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102492:98"/> doſt the more provoke and enrage him. And wouldſt thou reſiſt him in the mean while, whom thou muſt at length ſubmit unto? Nay, when thou art willing to be at Peace with him. Even thoſe who are now reconciled, and were once afar off, are vexed within themſelves that ever they ſhould have the leaſt Enmity againſt ſo gracious and ſo good a God. <hi>The Adverſaries of the Lord ſhall be aſhamed.</hi> And if thy ſelf doſt come to be agreed with him, thou wilt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent and be grieved for all thy former Ignorance, ſtrange Imaginations, but even for this Oppoſition and Doubting whether thou ſhouldſt preſently come over unto thy God. Conſider he is ſtronger and mightier than thou, He is all-wiſe and jealous of his Honour, and alſo he will be glorified in his Creatures. And ſhall they offend him now, becauſe they hope hereafter to pleaſe and pacifie him? Or will they take Advantage over him alſo as ſome do over his Servants, to affront them the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know beforehand, ſuch will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give. <hi>Is it good that God ſhould ſearch you out, or as one man mocketh another, do ye ſo mock him?</hi> Job 13. 9. <hi>Thine hand ſhall find out all thine Enemies; thy right hand ſhall find out thoſe that hate thee,</hi> Pſal. 21. 8. That is, <hi>find</hi> them out to puniſh them; and therefore God cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knows them with the meaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Hatred, they conceive againſt him. The ſin is againſt him, and alſo the pardon belongs to him; and alſo, he is the God to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102492:98"/> whom Vengeance belongeth. Now what is the Reaſon why he doth ſpare ſome, and puniſh others? He will do according to what he hath ſaid, <hi>He ſhall Judge the World with Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the People with his Truth,</hi> Pſal. 96. 13. And by that Truth he takes an eſtimate of People even now.</p>
               <p>God, who knows the hearts, will put a difference between Infirmity and Perverſeneſs, between unavoidable and willing Ignorance, what is to be allowed to the temptation, and what is their own fault: He doth apprehend all the meaning of his own Law and Word, and alſo all the doings of all the Sons of Men, every motion and thought of their Soul, and all that is within them. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it? I the Lord ſearch the heart, and try the reins, even to give to every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings,</hi> Jer. 17. 9, 10. He takes exact account and cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of all things; and here it is ſaid that it is in order to give to every Man according to the fruit of his doings; ſo that certainly it muſt be the better way to ſubmit inſtantly. For the preſent refuſal and neglect doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him, in the mean while thoſe ſtrugglings and conteſts do diſpleaſe him; when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts and admoniſhes, if they <hi>rebel and vex his holy Spirit, he will turn to be their enemy,</hi> Iſa. 63. 10. and fight againſt them. We know not when this will be, and therefore People ſhould
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102492:99"/> be exceeding cautious how they do in the leaſt diſpleaſe him: When the Scripture ſpeaks of God being angry, the ſame Word invites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to Reconciliation with him. <hi>Can two walk together except they be agreed?</hi> Amos 3. 3. Now God is continually with us, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are not ſenſible thereof; for he is with us in our going out and coming in, and he is with us in all our ways; and this would be a continued fear and trouble to the mind, unleſs we are at peace with him, and then it is a comfort and an aſſurance: And therefore thoſe who are afar off, do not think of God, but forget him, not knowing that they might have the thoughts of God, and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Name; be as familiar, yea, and as delightful as now they go on in their own darkneſs and imaginations; for here is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and continued doubt. They might come to live under the continued ſenſe of God, with the ſame, yea, and more exceeding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, than others do with the thoughts of any thing; as the Bridegroom rejoyces over the Bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoyce over thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 3. And reciprocally his people may live comfortably, and rejoyce in the Lord their God He is a ſhadow from the Heat, as a great Rock in a weary Land, a ſhelter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rom the Storm, an houſe of Defence, or ſtrong Habitation, <hi>whereunto we may continually reſort,</hi> Pſal. 71. 3. And many ſuch like expreſſions the Holy Ghoſt makes uſe of. As a woman
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102492:99"/> takes care of her ſucking Child, and a <hi>Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings,</hi> ſo is the Lord God to his People, to aſſure them of his continued Preſervation, Love, and Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards them.</p>
               <p>And any one may come over to be amongſt his People; as they that were not of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do come to be of them, ſo we do warn, teſtifie and exhort all men every where, of every age, or condition of life, whatever their paſt ſins be, and of whatever nature or multitude their preſent temptation and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are, yet ſtill they are invited to partake of the loving kindneſs of the Lord. What hinders? Let the thought, imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or excuſe be what it will, we could ſpeak and give a ſufficient anſwer unto it, from the Grace and Truth of God: We could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon even from the very firſt Principle of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make even the man himſelf, whether he be in a meer natural ſtate, or if he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what we ſay, whether he be learned or unlearned, yet we could leave it to every man to judge what is beſt even for himſelf to do, and which is lIkely to tend moſt unto his own good.</p>
               <p>Nothing is more certain and evident, Then that there is no fruit of Sin. It is <hi>like droſs,</hi> Pſal. 119. 119. which melts and ſlides away. The pleaſure or profit thereof paſſeth away, and comes to nothing at all; there is nothing therein which doth remain and endure; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102492:100"/> which will abide the Fire, or ſtand in any ſtead in the evil day: Not the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or happineſs can poſſibly ariſe from it: Wherefore then ſhould any one continue in Sin? Or, why ſhould any one go to add Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to Iniquity? To draw it on as with a Cart-Rope; when hereby he doth not only loſe ſo much good, but bring on himſelf the more guilt and miſery: If he hath offended God by former ſins, he doth yet more by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent continuance in the ſame; if he hath been filthy he will be worſe, by wallowing yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the mire; and the ſooner he draws back from the ways of wickedneſs, he will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate God's diſpleaſure againſt him. No fleſh can ſtand under the power of his Anger; they cannot endure, nor are their hearts ſtrong in the day when the Lord ſhall deal with them: And ſeeing we muſt all appear before him to receive Good or Evil, to be ſentenced unto Life or Death, What can be done too much to intreat our Judge in the mean while, that we may have him favourable and propitious, and be found accepted with him? What interceſſions and care ſhould be uſed againſt this great day of Trial and everlaſting Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? How ſhould we in the mean while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves towards him, that now ſits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove to take notice of thoſe who fear him and think on his Name, and alſo expecting till his Enemies be made his Footſtool? Thoſe who will not ſubmit willingly at firſt, muſt at
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102492:100"/> length by force; who will not do it of their own accord, ſhall be made to do it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould any debate or doubt ariſe in the minds of men concerning this? Had they not better forthwith cloſe in with that God of whom it is graciouſly written, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, who pardoneth Iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage? He retaineth not his anger for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he delighteth in mercy,</hi> Micah 7. 18. He would wink at, and paſs by former Iniquities, if People would be careful to pleaſe him for the time to come; if they would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly abuſe things as to ſtir up his Anger ſo much the more, becauſe he doth not retain it; nor yet to preſume upon that Mercy which he delighteth in. The right conſequence is, That if God doth not retain his Anger, then they ſhould not retain their Sins; if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in Mercy, they ſhould both Pray, and alſo endeavour to be Partakers thereof; to meet God, as it were, in the way of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; to have good-will towards him, that he may ſhew Mercy towards them; with what Affection thou behaveſt thy ſelf towards God, he will manifeſt the ſame towards thee. <hi>With the merciful thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf merciful; with an upright man thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf upright: With the pure thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf pure, and with the froward, thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf froward,</hi> Pſal. 18. 25, 26. According as men are, ſo will God be towards them.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:102492:101"/>
               <p>Now ſeeing that every one knows that it is in the power of God to ſave or deſtroy, to do good or to puniſh, no man can be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as to which he would partake of; for he would have the good, and avoid the evil: let him then go the moſt likely way to obtain the one and eſchew the other; and that is not to be determined by a ſudden thought, or ſlight apprehenſion of things; for ſuch may be the temptation and deluſion of Satan. But conſult the Word of God, the very truth and reality of things; for ſeeing that God made, doth now govern, and will diſpoſe of all things, we may reſt fully aſſured that ſo it ſhall be as he hath ſaid and decreed; where his Word doth promiſe Forgiveneſs, there the man may be aſſured thereof; as again, where it threatens Puniſhment, there he hath juſt cauſe to fear and dread it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Iſa. 55. 7. But the wicked think that this may be done hereafter; ſo that he is for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own way in the mean while. Then he will continue and go further in a wrong way, out of which he muſt at length come, or periſh; the longer he goes on therein, the more way it is to come back; thoſe things which he now doth, muſt be undone. He muſt endeavour to pleaſe and be reconciled with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102492:101"/> that God, whom now he provokes and ſets afar off. He muſt have an awful Regard and Reverence for him, whom he now deſpiſes. What ſtrangeneſs and contradiction would it be to do thoſe things now, which he ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after really wiſh and deſire that he had never done: Repentance comes in upon a better and more truly informed Judgment. <hi>When the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal came to himſelf,</hi> Luke 15. 17. then came in him the reſolution of going home, and framing right Principles of Life hence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: Then it is diſcerned that he was in an Error heretofore, that he had choſen the worſt part, but now he would mend, and lay hold of the better; then he verily aſſents, and is really reſolved, That if ſuch a thing were to do again, he would not do it. But how can this be, that when either he doth already, or might know as much, yet he doth the ſame?</p>
               <p>The whole doth depend upon a full and true knowledge, That God is to be obeyed and pleaſed in all things; and that it is beſt for men in all circumſtances, and at all times ſo to do. If in one inſtance, ſo likewiſe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and then in a third, and ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all parts of our Duty. It is better to be temperate in all things, than to run to the full exceſs of Riot, to <hi>do Righteouſneſs at all times,</hi> Pſal. 106. 3. then to practice wrong or deceit at any time: It is better to obſerve the ſeveral parts and ſtated ſeaſons of Worſhip, than to live in irreligion or contempt of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102492:102"/> God: It is grievous to have forſaken God, and it is good to draw near and hold faſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in every thing; this may be known by that long ſeries and tryal, how it is with the condition of Mankind; thoſe ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations and accidents, the ſundry changes and chances of this mortal Life, the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and what may ſeem ſevere trials, are to inſtruct in thus much. When the Hiſtory of God's Church and People is rehearſed, with an account of what things happened unto them. This, or the like inference, is made, <hi>That they might keep his Statutes, and obſerve his Laws,</hi> Pſal. 105. 45. And this is recorded for their Children, and to us, <hi>To the intent that we ſhould not forget God, nor turn aſide from his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> And as <hi>Moſes</hi> allowed Divorce to the <hi>Jews,</hi> for the hardneſs of their hearts; ſo it may be ſuppoſed that God doth admit Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to Repentance for their Ignorance and Imperfection; that if when they did not at firſt apprehend the excellency of his ways, yet if when they are convinced of the miſery and deceitfulneſs of their own ways, and when they have ſome trial and experience of God's ways, and there they find a real Worth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then they ſhould yield, and come over unto God.</p>

               <p>MAN hath ſome ſeeming Reaſon or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe why he ſtands off; Produce, and let it come forth, if an Anſwer and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction may be given unto it. <hi>Produce your Cauſe, ſaith the Lord, bring forth your ſtrong Reaſons, ſaith the King of Jacob,</hi> Iſa. 41. 21. No excuſe will ſerve with the God with whom we have to do, before whom all things are naked and opened, who underſtands our thoughts afar off, even what is at the bottom of that Excuſe. He requires Obedience and Subjection from every Creature, and from that there is no Diſpenſation or Allowance. Now every leaſt excuſe or delay, is a ſeeming kind of denial, and God diſcerns it as ſuch. There is ſome ground of that backwardneſs and unwillingneſs; If he would but conſider his own thoughts, he may apprehend where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he refuſes: Is it not the third thing aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, <hi>viz.</hi> People think that if they ſubmit preſently unto the Obedience of God, they ſhall be loſers, and diſappointed of ſo much
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102492:103"/> Pleaſure and Conveniency in the mean while; they ſhall miſs of ſo much imagined Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and fall into Vexation, Trouble, and Miſery.</p>
               <p>What a ſtrange Imagination doth here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelf at firſt; That Men ſhould be loſers by the Service of God; for they do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern a future Reward, which will be a more abundant compenſation for all preſent diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; the conſideration of a future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and preſent conveniency, do quite take off all manner of Excellency and Deſerving in any of the doings of the Children of Men. When God ſhall rehearſe and give a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the nature of his Government, and our Subjection, with an Hiſtorical Relation of it ſince he created Man upon the Earth, <hi>The Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day.</hi> For therein will appear his Bounty and Goodneſs in a moſt eminent manner, without the leaſt Thanks or degree of Merit due to any of his Creatures. For by Reaſon of our Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Want, there is ſo much Articling and Selfiſhneſs in us, that we will as it were do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for God, but what we are forced unto to keep our own Peace, or out of the Proſpect of Good and Recompence. As on the other hand, a little Frightning of Pain or ſeeming Inconvenience doth keep us off from our Duty unto him: What ſhall I get by it is the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of almoſt every one in what he takes in Hand? And as the Aſſurance of Profit and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102492:103"/> ſhall engage him in ſuch a Work; ſo again, the Fear of Loſs and Inconvenience ſhall make him refrain.</p>
               <p>Pleaſure and Pain are (if I may ſo expreſs it) the two moving Wheels of Action; which do actually incline to follow ſuch things, and fly from others, and thus he doth in common Matters. Now herein ſeems to be compriſed the <hi>Myſtery of God,</hi> That though in all things he requires of Men, there is a real Goodneſs and Worth, yea, and they are to be deſired; yet again, through wiſe Diſpoſal for a State of Tryal, they have a Shew of Evil, Loſs, and there is an Averſation to them: The Things of God are found moſt excellent, both upon full Examination and and Experience, yet they appear as harſh and aukward to the Generality of Mankind; which makes them fly off and keep ſo at a Diſtance. Now, were they inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Truth of the Matter, they would act ſo as to the things of God, as now they do to the common things of this World: And even what appears harſh and frightful, they would undertake it, if it would tend to a greater Good if it would (as we commonly ſay) tend unto Account, then they would be for it: All man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Eaſe and Sloth ſlides away at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; there can no Good come poſſibly of it. Now by Hardſhip and Diligence many great and good things are accompliſhed. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might thus think and reaſon within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, That when they give way to ſin and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102492:104"/> idleneſs, for ſeeming good and pleaſure, yet if by a contrary manner of Life, there would accrue more real Good and laſting Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this ſhould with them turn the Scales, and make them ſeek after the other; not only to confine unto the preſent, but withal take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſideration the Things to come; not to be fixed only upon what is juſt before them, but to have an Eye unto the Recompence of Reward; to have reſpect all along unto the Good and Glory which excelleth; to forbear and let ſlip a little preſent conveniency, out of foreſight and aſſurance of future and real Good. As again, To willingly ſuffer Loſs, or endure Hardſhip in the way of Duty, that God may make up for all in the Day of Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution.</p>
               <p>Indeed, all the actions of Man's Life are little, and may be done; there is nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us but what may be performed, and is ſoon over; ſo that we may boldly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it upon the Divine Command, upon God's Promiſe of Grace and Strength, to go through therewith; and alſo, from his further Favour and Encouragement. <hi>Whatſoever thine hand findeth thee to do, do it with all thy might.</hi> In whatever Work thou mayeſt be accepted by God, as having the direction of his Word, and the teaching of his Spirit, perform it readily and ſpeedily, during this Life of Vanity; before thy hands and feet are tyed and bound up with grave Clothes, whileſt
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102492:104"/> thou haſt powers of Action. Or if thou be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nwilling and would be excuſed, beware leſt the Thing be taken from thee, and given to another, who will perform the ſame, and ſo thou loſeſt the deſigned Reward, and thou at laſt be judged as one afraid, or as one who would not do the Will of God.</p>
               <p>Upon his being our Creator and our Lord, our Father and our Maſter, he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to do ſuch a thing, and we ſhould, as obedient Children and Servants, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with do the ſame. Agreeable hereunto was the practice of God's Servants of old Time, as <hi>Noah, Lot, Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> they did Serve and Worſhip God, and did many things purely out of his Command, without reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mercinarineſs. That is, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherefore, and alſo without a particular Promiſe of any more Reward from the hands of God. With ſuch Obedience, or Service, God was well pleaſed; and they are recorded for our admonition and enſample, upon whom the ends of the World are come: That albeit <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Immortality,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> are more clearly diſcovered and made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us than they were to our Fathers, yet we ſhould be altogether as zealous and diligent in the Work of the Lord as they were, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much conſideration had to what is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſed and aſſured unto us; but we ſhould do it only becauſe the Lord requires it, and then leave it unto him whether he will
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102492:105"/> make any Recompence; yea, and be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if he ſhould give none. We ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our ſelves <hi>unprofitable Servants, we have done only what was our duty to do</hi> It was God who brought us into being, and gave us power thus to act: ſo it is but a due return of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formed by him, even for the Engine to move as he would have it: It is juſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the End of our Maker; or, if this be left to our choice and freedom, it is better when ſo performed of a willing and ready mind; for God loves ſuch a diſpoſition of Soul. And if there be ſuch an Heart in People, all the future Diſcourſe would be in vain, for they would both offer and act willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without being preſſed to it: Let the way be only ſhewed, they will both walk, yea, and run in it, without being pricked forward; let it be declared what they have to do, and they will forthwith actually do it, without ſo much argument and perſuaſion. If any one through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſures, and clearly demonſtrates unto them, That the Lord hath ſaid and enjoyned them thus, there is need of no more words, for we will do it. Truly God is good, and all things <hi>ſhall work together for good to them that love God, and that are called according to the purpoſe of his Will,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. And we will truſt in the general, without being particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly told how the ſeveral things are ſo: We will commit our way unto the Lord, and keep ſtedfaſt in his Covenant, come Life or Death,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:102492:105"/> Shame or Diſhonour, good Report or evil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, Loſs or Advantage; being aſſured that God will ſo over-rule things in his Providence, that even theſe contrary things ſhall tend yet more to our real and enduring Happineſs. Thoſe Saints of old, who were hungry and thirſty, are now come to that place where they are filled, and they do enjoy the fulneſs and fatneſs of God's Houſe. It is a greater degree of Happineſs to have been miſerable, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect that the contrary Evil is done away, and there ſucceeds in the room a greater good and fulneſs; ſo that even Self-denial and Hardſhip do make way for more Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reſt. Let this mind be in you which was in Chriſt Jeſus, who went about doing good; whoſe Meat and Drink it was to do the Will of his Heavenly Father, who did not much regard the periſhing Comforts of this World, as to be fully employed in and faithfully diſcharge that Meſſage he was ſent about. So <hi>Job</hi> did more regard the Words of God's Mouth than his neceſſary Food. For the one was of more Concernment and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Advantage to himſelf than the other, as it was found at laſt. And though this might not be at firſt apprehended, yet the ſenſe of his Duty to God did make him give the Eſteem and Preference. Where is Love and Good-will towards God, this makes that his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do not ſeem grievous. They are indeed repreſented ſo by the Tempter, who would
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102492:106"/> keep off from the Obſervance of them; but they are not ſo in themſelves. And this hath been at ſundry times cleared and manifeſted both by the inſpired Men, who wrote as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt; and alſo by other Labourers in God's Vineyard, who out of their VVritings, and from the very Reality and Reaſon of things, have brought out the Truth. The like alſo we have endeavoured by God's Grace and Aſſiſtance to ſhew, and even to demonſtrate unto the moſt natural and ungodly Man. VVho keeps off becauſe of this Frightning and Temptation, and therefore we addreſſed unto him, if he would but judge of what he is vainly afraid to practiſe; for then his former Fear and Averſation would wear off, and he would experimentally find the Truth and Reality of things, as they are there ſpoken of. The Subject is, <hi>Of Happineſs;</hi> wherein it is fully and particularly manifeſted that the greateſt Happineſs of this Life conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the Fear of God and keeping his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, in Oppoſition to the Pleaſures of Sin, or the pretended Conveniency of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. By <hi>Richard Stafford.</hi> VVhich is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to the preſent Evil and Pain of ſeveral Sins there named, and alſo of the Good and Excellency of the commanded Duties there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in. And the like may in the ſame manner be demonſtrated of all the reſt, either mentioned in the VVord of God, or ever heard of, even as to all the Actions and Doings of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102492:106"/> Men, whatever they are concerned in, ſo it is differently of the Good and Evil, Duty and Sin, of what is commanded or what is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. <hi>Therefore I eſteem all thy Precepts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all things to be right, and I hate every falſe Way,</hi> Pſal. 119. 128. The like Nature runs through them all that they are really good and deſirable, yea, and to be obſerved. So in every falſe VVay there is Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Miſery which ſhould be avoided. And was there a like Obſervance of all God's Precepts, and an abſtaining from all Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Evil, any one would both judge and experimentally find the ſame, as the Man after God's own Heart did. But by reaſon of that abundant Sin and Corruption which is every where, and hath ſpread it ſelf over all Nations and Men; yea, and there is alſo a reſerved Iniquity in thoſe who ſeem to be VVorſhippers and Servants of God; which like the Herb that cauſed Death in the Pot, ſo this occaſions Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erneſs and Miſery: And therefore this great Truth is ſcarce diſcernable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O that thou hadſt hearkned to my Commandments; then had thy Peace been as a River, and thy Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as the Waves of the Sea,</hi> Iſa. 48. 18. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have Respect unto all thy Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119. 6. I ſhall not live in Doubt and Miſery: I ſhall not be diſappointed of ſo much pretended Good or Conveniency, as may be thought to be had in the Tranſgreſſion of this or that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102492:107"/> as the Sinner thinks expedient. In the forementioned Place of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 18. It is firſt ſaid, <hi>Thy Peace had been as a River,</hi> and then <hi>thy Righteouſneſs as the Waves of the Sea,</hi> which mounts up and aſcends on high. So it is here ſaid in the following Verſe of this Pſalm laſt quoted, <hi>I will praiſe thee with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs of Heart, when I ſhall have learned thy righteous Judgments.</hi> Both which are given to ſignifie, and from hence we may learn that the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God's choſen doth not only conſiſt in a <hi>perfect Peace</hi> and <hi>true Satisfaction of Mind,</hi> tho' theſe are things very deſirable, and beyond what the World gives. But it breaks forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Singing and Joy unſpeakable, full of Glory. <hi>That I may ſee the Good of thy choſen, that I may rejoyce in the Gladneſs of thy Nation,</hi> Pſal. 106. 5. Here are aſcending Steps, one after another. There is not only a Freedom from Evil and Miſery, nor yet only a Stayedneſs and full Content of Mind; but it hath further Delight and Refreſhment, and alſo can expreſs it ſelf forth, as others ſhew forth outward Signes of Rejoycing. So that when the World ſhall be perfectly obedient, and what is conſequent to that, reconciled unto God, when <hi>his People ſhall be all righteous,</hi> Iſa. 60. 21. and each Man and Woman throughout the Earth obſerve all Parts and every leaſt Tittle of their Duty to God, they ſhall not be dull nor yet in deep Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But they ſhall be more merry, talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and pleaſant in ſpeaking of and praiſing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102492:107"/> God for his wonderful works, than now they are, or have ever yet been about other things. <hi>Their Heart ſhall rejoyce as through Wine, their Heart ſhall rejoyce in the Lord,</hi> Zech. 10. 7. which will very much exceed the Mirth of Tabret or Harp; or the <hi>Joy of Feaſts.</hi> Their Talking ſhall be of God's Doings, declaring his Truth and ſinging forth the Praiſes of the Lord: In which they ſhall find more Variety, yea, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Satisfaction, than heretofore in ſpending their Time in hearing or telling of ſome new thing, ſome little Novelty, idle Story, or fooliſh Jeſting. They ſhall more rejoyce in the ſeveral Parts of Duty, than formerly in the Pleaſures of Sin for a Seaſon. All the Briskneſs and pretended Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that compared with the Joy and Exſtacy of God's Choſen, ſhall be darkened and exceeded as the Light of the Moon is by that of the Sun; or as the ſmall and faint burning of a Candle is to the Lights of Heaven. The ſeeming Activity of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and men of Valour; all that Shew of Brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Renown and Courage, whereby in Times paſt the <hi>Abaddon</hi> and Deſtroyer hath ſtirred up Thouſands to butcher and kill one another ſhall be infinitely exceeded by the Lord of Hoſts, and by his Army of Saints, according to what is written, <hi>They ſhall run like mighty Men, They ſhall climb the Wall like Men of War, and they ſhall march every one on his Ways, and they ſhall not break their Ranks, They ſhall run to and fro in the City, they ſhall run upon the Walls, they ſhall climb up upon the Houſes: They ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the Windows like a Thief; and the Lord ſhall ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Voice before his Army, for his Camp is very great; for he is ſtrong that executeth his Word; for the Day of the Lord is great and very terrible, and who can abide</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:102492:108"/> 
                  <hi>it,</hi> Joel 2. 7, 9, 11. Their Speed, Reſolution and Order ſhall as much exceed that of the moſt excellent and victorious Army which was ever heard of ſince the VVorld began, as they do a Flock or Herd of Sheep.</p>
               <p>God is glorified by Action; when the Powers which he hath given, are exerted, and then he will give yet more; when little Creatures do great things; when what before lay hid, is put forth. <hi>Thy People ſhall be willing in the Day of thy Power,</hi> Pſal. 110. 3. The Lord himſelf ſhall again awake as one out of Sleep, and like a Giant refreſhed with VVine. As he endues every thing that hath Life and Breath with Powers of Action or Motion, ſo himſelf will cauſe that that it be manifeſted forth, he will ſubdue his Enemies in the hindermoſt Parts, and put them to a perpetual Shame. Thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Paſſions ſhall be ſtretched out and come ſorth in the VVicked: So again, the delighting Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſhall be ſtirred up in the Good, and vent forth in the utmoſt Gladneſs and Pleaſure. <hi>Thou ſhalt increaſe my Greatneſs, and comfort me on every Side. I will alſo praiſe thee with the Pſaltery, even thy Truth O my God, unto thee will I ſing with the Harp O Thou holy One of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>My Lips ſhall greatly rejoyce when I ſing unto thee, and my Soul which thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,</hi> Pſal. 71. 21, 22, 23. Here in this VVorld of Oppoſition, Sin and Temptation, we do meet with <hi>great and ſore Troubles;</hi> but when once thoſe are done away, there will ſucced a more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Degree of Joy and Conſolation. This is figured by that Phraſe ſo uſual in the Prophets, of Joy in the Harveſt. It is but a faint and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Compariſon to ſet forth the Tranſports and Extaſies which ſhall be of God's People. As a <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:102492:108"/> 
                  <hi>rejoyceth over his Bride,</hi> ſo ſhall the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce oves his People; and they reciprocally ſhall joy in the God of their Salvation, who were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly poſſeſſed with Horrour and Dread, they do at length arrive at Reverence and Good-will, and then their Souls do greatly rejoyce in God, and he doth put Gladneſs into their Hearts more than can be expreſſed by Corn and Wine, or any worldly thing. When we do ſincerely and actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour to be holy, as he that hath called us is holy, then he is perfectly reconciled unto us. Notwithſtanding his infinite Greatneſs, he doth humble himſelf to become familiar to our Nature. All former Averſeneſs and Enmity are vaniſhed away: And we being fully reſolved to keep his Commandments at all Times, and that our Lord ſhall guide us continually, he doth according to his gracious Promiſe, keep him in perfect Peace, whoſe Mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſteth on thee.</p>
               <p>We may ſee and perceive a tittle Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereof in the Communion of Saints here on Earth; who, when they are obedient and like-minded, do find exceeding Joy and Sweetneſs with one another, as they talk of and derive it down from the God above. The like will be much more in the Times of univerſal Reformation, <hi>when the whole Earth ſhall be at Reſt and Quiet, it ſhall break forth into Singing,</hi> Iſa. 14. 7. the one before the other. The Pleaſures of Sin, or the Laughter of the World are not ſo much to that as ſounding Braſs and tinkling Cymbal compared with the beſt Muſick. All carnal Joy is now ſudden, mix'd and unſatisfying: But what comes down from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits, or ariſes from doing his Will, that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:102492:109"/> doth remain and is ſincere, gives a bleſſed Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till we awake after his Likeneſs and are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with it. The Joy is ſuitable with our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Condition here, it increaſes as we grow up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Perfection; and is in us a Well of Water ſpringing up unto eternal Life. This Kind of Joy doth tranſmit over to Enjoyment. It is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Foretaſt of that, wherewith we ſhall be happy for ever. It is ſenſibly in us according as we have Aſſurance, and approach near to the receiving thereof.</p>
               <p>There is an Agreeableneſs between our Work and Reward. Now our Work is to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and be doing his Will. The Commandments are for <hi>our Good always;</hi> as every thing muſt be which proceeds from him, who is moſt perfectly and eſſentially good. <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep Judgment, and he that doth Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs at all Times,</hi> Pſal. 106. 3. It is better ſo to do at preſent; for they have more Peace and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as alſo the Promiſe of future Recompence.</p>
               <p>Many things are here ſuffered in this Time of Trial, and Hour of Temptation which is come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that dwell on the Earth, but yet it goes well with them that fear the Lord, that fear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before him; who when they are tryed are found faithful and obedient, theſe ſhall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him, Who can now withſtand and overcome the Temptation, and truſt unto the Lord for a greater Recompence. If the Sin had been conſented unto, the Pleaſure or Profit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of could never have countervailed the Loſs of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Peace of Mind and the bleſſed Expectation
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102492:109"/> further on. All things are derived in order to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and preſent Happineſs: Now our God doth furniſh us with every thing pertaining to this, whilſt we continue in the Way of Duty, and we do not turn aſide from his Commandments to the Right Hand or to the Left. To each of them ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to all together joyntly, there is annexed ſtrong Conſolation and Aſſurance; the one as to the preſent, and the other as to what ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. We are truly pleaſed in doing what we ought, and we have a ſure and certain Hope of good things to come. VVhereas in Tranſgreſſion is Doubt and Reſtleſneſs, and fearful Expectation. And ſo in abſtaining from evil and forbidden things, There may be a little Regret and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs through corrupt Nature; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards there ſucceds more Content and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Denial of it, than if one had yielded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temptation. And further, there is a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the bleſſed Hope and glorious Enjoyment, which ſhall be to thoſe who do now comply with the Will of God.</p>
               <p>If we go through the ſeveral Parts and Steps of our Duty, as alſo the ſeveral Degrees and Sorts of Sins, we ſhall ſind this to be trne. Indeed, in the firſt there may be a little Irkſomneſs and Averſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which cannot make miſerable, for it inſtantly paſſeth away. It may be reſolutely gone through with and overcome, and this would lay up a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for a greater Happineſs and Reward. So in the latter there may be a ſlight Semblance of Pleaſure and Eaſe, which cannot make happy, for this ſoon paſſeth away and comes to nothing, and alſo it tends unto an exceeding Condemnation and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102492:110"/> Loſs; and further, it involves into eternal Pain and Puniſhment: Beſides, the Conſideration of a different Futurity, It may be obſerved at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fent Time, that though in the Way of Duty there may be Labour and Trouble to the Fleſh, yet there is Joy and Peace in the inward Man, which abundantly countervails for that: So in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Tranſgreſſion, there may be a ſmall Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and pleaſing of the Body, but to it is annexed Fear and Vexation of Soul, which is as a bitter Allay to the other. The Soul is the Man, and he that would build up for himſelf a real Good and Happineſs, muſt conſult for that eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. For beſides; that it is the more enduring Subſtance and ſurvives the Body, ſo even now it gives the Reſentment of Good or Evil, Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Miſery. Indeed, all the Happineſs or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of this preſent Time is not to be accounted of; for whatever delights or vexes, ſoon paſſeth away, and we are gone: It is tranſitory and in continual haſting by; but ſeeing that further we are to receive for the things done in the Body, whether good or evil, the Reward of one, and Puniſhment of the other muſt indeed make eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy or miſerable. We ought to take the utmoſt Heed, leaſt by declining what may ſeem a little harſh or laborious. what may render liable to a ſmall ſuffering or Shame, we do hereby loſe the Recompence of Reward. So again, by giving Way to the Pleaſures of Sin for a Seaſon, or the preſent Profit of Unrighteouſneſs, we may plunge our ſelves into eternal Pain and Loſs. The Pleaſures of Sin do not truly content at the very Moment, when there is a real and ſenſible Delight inreceiving
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102492:110"/> the things of God according to his Laws and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Rules. So in the Gains of Wrong and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, in taking Bribes or undue Rewards, he may be a little pleaſed for a while, yet there is Regret and Fear, the one for what is already done, and the other for what is to come. So that whatever Plenty or Abundance the unjuſt Man hath, yet his State and Condition is not comparable to the peaceable Fruits of Righteouſneſs, to that Man who obſerves the true and ſtrict Rules thereof, and hath only the Bleſſing and Increaſe of his honeſt Labour and Diligence.</p>
               <p>Sin and Diſobedience will not admit of a through Conſideration, but muſt go on with Hurry and Neglect; whereas Obedience and Righteouſneſs will <hi>prove its own Work and find a rejoycing therein,</hi> Gal. 6. 4. It deſires the moſt particular Thought and Examination, and ſtill it hath ſincere Comfort and a bleſſed Hope and Aſſurance. Even thoſe, who do not act by a Senſe of Duty towards God, are led by preſent Pleaſure, Profit, Conveniency or Advantage. And were they alike perſwaded, that there was more abundantly to be had in the Ways of God, theſe ſame Perſons would be moved to walk therein. Reduce all things to a Man's ſelf, his own Good and Happineſs: This, though it be ſomewhat further about, and it is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon ſo noble and excellent a Principle, yet it may bring him over unto good. But the right and direct Way is for a Man to give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God in the firſt Place ſincerely and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly reſolving to live in Obedience and Duty unto him in all things, come what will thereof, and truſt wholly unto God for the Event of all things;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102492:111"/> for thus one may keep whole and ſtedfaſt in his Covenant, and not turn aſide from his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the right hand or to the left. He may go through with and underſtand thoſe doubtful Diſpenſations of Providence which are therefore given to exerciſe our Faith and Truſt on him at all times. To hold on ſtill in every Affliction, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Diſappointment, being aſſured however croſs or contrary they may ſeem at preſent, yet we know that <hi>All things work together for good to them that love God, to them that are the called accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8. 28.</p>
               <p>Whereas thoſe who ſeek their own good direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immediately in the firſt place, and have more reſpect unto that than to the Glory and Law of God, they are apt to miſtake ſudden Eaſe and Pleaſure, or preſent Conveniency for real Good, and to meaſure their Obligations and Rules of Duty by what ſeems to make for or againſt that. If they imagine the thing may expoſe them to Danger and Trouble, then it is asked, Doth the Lord require it of them? And they will find out a Deluſion, or conceit to themſelves that he doth not, or they would willingly be excuſed, nay, ſome run into that Danger and common Error, ſeeing that the Lord hath commanded all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments for our good always; they think ſuch an Inſtance is not for their good, and from thence they would conclude that it is none of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments The Errour lies in their own Mind and wrong Imagination; for the thing is true as God hath eſtabliſhed it; Whatſoever he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded is for our preſent Peace and Comfort and future Recompence. But many through want of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:102492:111"/> Knowledge, Faith, and Truſt on God, do not diſcern it is ſo. Certainly preſent Peace and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Glory is much beyond the utmoſt good that was ever had by Sin and Tranſgreſſion. The firſt is ſenſible, and of the other we have aſſured Hope and Evidence from the ſame God whom it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to love; and even now gives us the things which we taſte, ſee, handle, and enjoy. Such Food is nevertheleſs good and wholeſome though a ſick Stomach cannot reliſh it ſo; but it may ſeem to that evil and bitter. And when by Reaſon of Iniquity the <hi>whole Head is ſick and the whole Heart is faint,</hi> then it cannot ſo clearly apprehend and perceive the Sweet and Goodneſs of Obedience and Duty. The things are nevertheleſs real and the very ſame though Blindneſs doth not ſee them, and Ignorance doth not know them. And ſo it is of the whole divine Will and Commandment, which is excellent and Profitable. <hi>Her Ways are Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all her Paths are Peace,</hi> Pro. 3. 17. Albeit, thoſe who are alienated from the Life of God do not throughly conceive how it is ſo.</p>
               <p>It was God who put this Goodneſs into things, for that is the Return made upon the ſeveral days Work of the Creation, <hi>And God ſaw that it was good,</hi> Gen. 1, 12. ſo it was in their original Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo it is in their further Eſtabliſhment and Order; for they are Derivations from his own Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. God, who is infinitely good, cannot make any thing but what good is. Thus it is as to all his Works and Doings. He cannot command any thing but what is alſo good.</p>
               <p>Indeed, through the Intermixture of Sin and Evil, which came in afterwards, there may be
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102492:112"/> Trouble and Reſiſtance: Through the Wiles and Hindrances of Satan, and the Powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there may be Care and Vexation; but to avoid and overcome is Joy and Glory. To coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and reſolutely go on ſtill, to behold Satan falling from Heaven as Lightning, and to have the Spirits ſubject unto us, Here is exceeding Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and praiſing God on this Behalf. Our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture loves to have Oppoſition, and rejoyces to get over it. The utmoſt here is but the like Pain and Trouble, which others willingly undergo for the things of this World, and they are contented, though they act upon Uncertainty and Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if they ſhould at length obtain, yet they cannot keep but muſt be taken away from it. But for the good things God hath promiſed, the Way to come at them is chalked out in his Word, and ſhewed in our Mind. And we know when we do accordingly, as plainly as when a Maſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his Servant to go, he heareth his Voice and goeth accordingly. There is alike and greater Comfort of Mind in doing the Will of God as a Man hath when he returneth from his daily Work in the Evening. And there is the full Aſſurance of Faith and Hope unto the End, as when one hath done ſomething more towards it, and expects to ſee an End, and enjoy the Fruits of his Labours.</p>
               <p>The preſent Acts are little and ſudden; but the good and evil are more remote and diſtant, yet aſſuredly conſequent to them. This will render either happy or miſerable; and as the ſeveral Actions will do this more or leſs, ſo they are to be deſired or avoided. Is ſuch a thing for our preſent Happineſs or Miſery, which is for a Moment? But
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:102492:112"/> how ſtands it as to our future Happineſs or Miſery, which is exceeding and eternal, And this ſhould chiefly ſway and determine us in whatever we take in hand, knowing that the Time to come will be equally preſent and remain longer before us, than this Moment in which we now live. The leſs Concern muſt give way to the greater. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is to be preferred before Time; for our ſelf is as nearly concerned in one as in the other.</p>
               <p>The Commandments of God are ſaid to be <hi>for our good always,</hi> even now, henceforth, and for ever and ever. The good which is now only in Beginning doth increaſe, till it aſcends up into eternal Life and Bleſſedneſs. But as to the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and Violation of them, the utmoſt pretended Benefit thereof is only a ſudden Conveniency or momentary Sweetneſs, which ſoon endeth in Regret of Bitterneſs; and unleſs God's Mercy and our own Repentance doth interpoſe, it renders us lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto endleſs Pain and Puniſhment. In Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Righteouſneſs there is even at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Time a ſenſible Comfort, Joy and Peace. Now what more can be deſired in this World? What is more valuable than <hi>perfect Peace?</hi> Or that full Aſſurance and Stayedneſs of Mind, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the preſent, but withal deſires after better and greater things to come. Even now to delight in God, and to pant and thirſt after a more full and cloſe Enjoyment of him. To walk with Chearfulneſs and Pleaſure in the Way of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. To have a further hungring after Righteouſneſs, but yet a moſt earneſt coveting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the heavenly Reward and Bleſſedneſs. To take with a quiet Mind all the ſeveral Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:102492:113"/> and kinds of Providence, holding our Faith and truſt ſtill. <hi>I will hope yet continually, and praiſe thee yet more and more.</hi> To magnifie and bleſs God ſtill, when things ſeem contrary; for there will yet be a right and an expected End. <hi>Although the Fig-Tree ſhall not bloſſom, yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salvation,</hi> Hab. 3. 18. The apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him above, makes all things here below ſweet, and the worſt, ſuch as may be endured: For God will in the mean time give ſtrength to bear, and aſſured deliverance out of it.</p>
               <p>By this may be ſeen the weakneſs of our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we are ſo very fearful of every Evil that can, or we imagine may do us the leaſt hurt. And alſo there is a ſenſe of our want and imperfection, of our poor and low Eſtate, that we are ſo greedy, and catching after every ſmall thing which we think may do good, or pleaſe us a little. We are lovers of our ſelves, and conſult only for our ſelves, more than what the Lord our God doth require of us. Now indeed, ſelf-love is not to be blamed, for it is the great Law of Nature, and was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly implanted in us by the Author thereof. No Man hateth his own Fleſh, but loves and cheriſheth it. But the Error and Miſtake is, That we do ſnatch at the Leſſer Good, inſtead of the greater; and ſo by declining, and avoiding a leſs Evil; we run upon a greater, and ſubject our ſelves to more loſs. We do not in the firſt place ſeek the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, and truſt that all theſe things ſhall be added unto us. Nor do we obſerve our Duty to him in all things, and depend upon him for the Event of all. We are to ſeek after a true, proper, and enduring Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:102492:113"/> and conſequently, to do, and embrace every thing which makes for that, and decline what is contrary, or an hindrance.</p>
               <p>In every thing we take in hand, remember the End, and thou ſhalt never do amiſs; and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent examine as to each ſingle Action we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in, Whether the Good or Evil conſequent to us thereby will be greater? Taking in the conſideration of the future, as well as of the time that now is. For that is as much longer, and of greater concern, as Eternity doth exceed Time, which is more than our whole Life is to the twinkling of an Eye, and conſequently deſerves ſo much the greater regard and concern, even of thoſe things which are done out of Humour, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, Luſt or Pleaſure, the ſuppoſed good or conveniency inſtantly paſſeth away, but the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and evil is great; for by <hi>Reaſon of theſe things the wrath of God cometh on the children of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> The pain and puniſhment will more than ſufficiently requite for gratifying their own will and concupiſcence. Though they hug themſelves, and they walk in the falſe peace and imagination of their Heart, yet a day of Recompence will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly come, when it ſhall be rendred unto them for all the ſweet and pleaſure of their Sin and Tranſgreſſion. So on the other hand, all the ſeeming trouble, or loſs of Obedience and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, ſhall be recompenced with a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Reward. As for thoſe who go on in a more blind hurry and neglect, their Time and Life paſſeth away, and Satan thus deceiveth them into Ruine and Perdition. This ſhort Queſtion might be ſtill put to our Souls, and ſhould ever
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:102492:114"/> be in our Mind, What do I propoſe to my ſelf? What Good will come of it? Is ſuch a Profit or Pleaſure to be attained? Why, the like hath been had already, it ſatisfieth not at the very time, it quickly paſſeth away, and comes to an utter end. But if it is the effect of Diſobedience and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; why, This hath a juſt Recompence of Reward annexed to it, which will be bitterneſs in the End, and a ſevere compenſation for whatever unlawful delight or gain he hath had. As the ſeveral ſteps to a Journey, ſo the ſingle and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Actions of our Life tend unto Happineſs or Miſery; they do either ſet forward the one, or make liable unto the other. It is a <hi>laying in a good foundation againſt the time to come,</hi> or a <hi>treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi> Who would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin if he did conſider that he ſhould receive doubly for it? When there is no fruit at the time, and certain puniſhment to come. And ſo, who would not go on, and continue in all Duty, ſeeing that he ſhall have aſſuredly ſuch encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reward?</p>
               <p>Every one propoſes to himſelf Happineſs and Good as the End of his Actions; but he would do well to take heed whether he doth endeavour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a true and enduring Happineſs, inſtead of a ſeeming and ſudden conveniency? Whether he can diſcern what is really good and profitable all the days of his vain Life which he ſpendeth upon Earth as a ſhadow? And not confine himſelf only to thoſe Actions which periſh in the uſing, and it would be better if they had never been done. All the pretended advantage of them is ſoon over, the guilt remains, but the worſt is to come, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:102492:114"/> 
                  <hi>To ſuffer the due Reward of their deeds.</hi> If the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment were preſently annexed to ſin and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, all would refrain from it, as many do from Religion and Duty, becauſe they imagine it harſh and irkſome. But becauſe the little and inſipid pleaſure of ſin is preſent, and the pain to come; they greedily catch at the firſt, and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ignorantly venture upon the other.</p>
               <p>What is to come, is not as yet, but it will as certainly be, and alſo remain, when all theſe things are paſſed away. <hi>The World paſſeth away, and the faſhion thereof,</hi> both the luſt and trouble therein. The firſt is only an husk, ſhell, or an appearance of Happineſs, ſo is the other of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; nay, all here is but as Imagery and Varniſh, and meer Out-ſide. <hi>Surely every Man walketh in a vain ſhew,</hi> Pſal. 39. 6. In the Margent there it is, <hi>In an Image.</hi> Our Bodies are as ſhadows, our Souls little more than nothing. <hi>Surely every Man in his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity.</hi> And yet this is flect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and haſteth away; day after day, and night after night, our Time paſſeth, and our fleſh waxes old, as doth a garment. Nothing here doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, or endure with us; and yet we covet, and earneſtly deſire after what is ſo. Indeed if we were to paſs by, and to be no more for ever, then we ſhould make the moſt of theſe temporal and periſhing Things; but ſeeing they are in order to what is Eternal and Enduring, we ſhould ſo uſe and manage our ſelves towards theſe earthly and temporal Things, that we may come to the Enjoyment and Poſſeſſion of the Heavenly and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; ſo to approve our ſelves in the time of Trial, that we may have the acceptation of our
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:102492:115"/> God; to be <hi>as obedient Children,</hi> that he may give unto us the Heavenly Portion and Inheritance; ſo to demean our ſelves here in Time, that we may attain unto a Bleſſed Eternity. God, who eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and ordained all things as they are, ſent us here to prove what is in our heart, and what we will do; He hath ſet different things before us, to ſee what we will chooſe; He hath afforded us the means and capacity of Knowledge, if we would but learn and know; if we would <hi>Obey the Lord our God, and walk in all his ways,</hi> and rely upon that gracious Promiſe, <hi>I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my People,</hi> Jer. 7. 23. He will ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, diſpoſe, and give us things, as ſhall tend to our comfortable Being here, our Crown and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the utmoſt and continual Rejoycing hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>If we can be happy at laſt, and for evermore, that is all which we deſire; if we can paſs on, and go through this World, we are contented to ſuffer Labour and Wearineſs, knowing that we ſhall come to the Reſt which the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: And that will be more ſweet and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the more pain and difficulty we have ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe few and evil days of our Pilgrimage. If they were good and pleaſant, they ſenſibly fly away as a Poſt, and it is melancholy and regret to find, that what delights ſhould paſs away. It is yet more anguiſh and ſorrow, that it muſt be at length wholly determined, and come to an utter End. It is the utmoſt Deſpair, and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Vexation, That for the unlawful uſe of thoſe good things he had in this Life, he muſt, when that is ended, come to the Place where he
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:102492:115"/> ſhall be tormented. But now, on the other hand, to <hi>Reſt from their Labours,</hi> to be <hi>comforted for the evil things they had here,</hi> this indeed is the Great and True Bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p>This ſhould teach us to uſe the things of this World as if we uſed them not; but above all, carefully to obſerve every tittle and part of our Duty, to abſtain from all appearance of Evil, for it may be all continually done from time to time, with a very little irkſomneſs, trouble and loſs, and there is a moſt happy End of all. This third time citing that place, is the more to enforce the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance thereof, <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he that doth Righteouſneſs at all times,</hi> Pſa. 106. 3. <hi>In keeping of them there is great Reward,</hi> Pſa. 19. 11. The word, <hi>keep,</hi> denotes a conſtant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to them, come what will thereof. Who is reſolved with full purpoſe of Heart to cleave unto God, and to obſerve all his Statutes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any Temptation, Difficulty, or Hindrance to the contrary. The Temptation may be overcome, for it might indeed pleaſe a little, but that would be ſudden at the Time, and unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory in the Concluſion thereof, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the not yielding to it, can be no great loſs or miſery. But then is a content and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of Mind afterwards, and alſo the vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the time to come: Alſo, the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be conquered, and the hindrance taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, without much trouble or pain, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution or leſſening of preſent Happineſs; but it exceedingly furthers as to the Future and Eternal Bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p>If it was throughly inculcated, and continually
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102492:116"/> repeated upon our mind, How that the beſt things which happen here will not make us happy, nor the worſt miſerable; If we had a right knowledge of all things in their own nature, not heightned in Imagination, we might eaſily go through all parts of Duty, and avoid the ſeveral Inſtances and Acts of Sin, as the one doth occur, and the other preſent themſelves. Indeed ſuch a thing being the Will and Mind of God, ſhould preſently ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence all other conſiderations drawn from ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the love of our ſelves. But (as was before ſomewhat hinted) to ſhut out all boaſting and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>That the Lord alone may be exalted in that day,</hi> we do little or nothing purely for him, but all out of reſpect had to our ſelves; and if we were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently convinced, it would as much redound to our own good and benefit, we would then obey the Lord our God, and walk in all his ways. This is evident, For the very reaſon why People walk in their own ways, is, becauſe of the ſuppoſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and conveniency thereof. Now alike, and greater Profit would turn them into the right way. <hi>Preſent Peace,</hi> and <hi>Future Glory,</hi> do ſurmount all the Pleaſure and Profit which can be had here; and <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> are rather to be ſought after, than blind dangerous inconſideration, or the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expectation of the end of thoſe things which is Death. It is better to ſin not, and be innocent, than to give way unto the doing of thoſe things whereof we muſt give account; for hence ariſes doubt and fear. We may quickly find and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the utmoſt good and delight, which ſpring up from Diſobedience and Tranſgreſſion; the ſame hath been had before. <hi>It melts away like droſs, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:102492:116"/> 
                  <hi>a foulneſs behind, which turns into nothing.</hi> This may be obſerved of the ſeveral Acts of Sin and Temptation; which go out like the ſnuff of a Candle in noiſom dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. How can men expect Happineſs from thoſe things by which they die and become miſerable? <hi>What Fruit had ye then in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> It it is all but traſh, which inſtantly periſhes in the going down, and doth not nouriſh; which is as inſignificant as a mere Tale that is told, or expires as a <hi>Dream when one awaketh;</hi> which is but faint and languiſhing in the Act, and bitter in the Remembrance.</p>
               <p>If there was previous Thought and Conſideration of theſe Things, Men would not ſo much yield to them. But alas! They diſcern it moſt commonly by the Effects and Conſequents; and that not throughly, till it is too late. When the time of Tryal is over, then they know how they ſhould behave themſelves; and when he will prove them no longer, then they would approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto God. The Matter is underſtood at the End, but not at the beginning; whereas this is too late if it is but once laid before us, as ſuch are the concernments of Eternity. We being proved in this Life only, but many other Things of this Life are often and ſucceſſively laid before us; and this ſhould reach us to amend our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Errors, and carry our ſelves Right at the next Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and Trial. To have the free uſe of our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Faculties, and our Senſes continually exerciſed to diſcern between Good and Evil, That we may ſeek after and embrace all that can be had of the one, and as ſtudiouſly decline all the hurt and defilements of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To know and practice all thoſe things for which we ſhall have the Voice of our Lord, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant:</hi> And again, carefully avoid and leave undone all thoſe things which tend to ſad account and condemnation. <hi>What profit is there of all the Labour that a Man taketh under the Sun?</hi> In Truth none at all; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be in order to future Life. And when we come to fully know and perceive as much, We ſhould direct all our Actions accordingly. That like as the Men of this
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102492:117"/> preſent Time do think in whatever they take in hand, What Good or Profit will accrue to my ſelf hereby? So the ſame may be continually thought of as to the time to come. What advantage or ſtead will this Thing ſtand me in when I ſhall come to give account of my ſelf to God? The conſideration of Things to come, by reaſon of their ſo much exceeding Greatneſs and Duration, ſhould ſwallow up all the care and concern of this preſent Time. We do not ſo much value how things go with us now, ſo it may be well with us hereafter. We are not ſo much concerned for whatever we may miſs of in this Time and Place, ſo we may lay hold of Eternal Life. It is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whatever Trouble, Pain, or Striving we endure, if <hi>we may hy any means attain unto the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> And then, we ſhould not ſo much Article for Happineſs or Miſery in the mean while, if we did look out to this vaſt and enduring State. Lord Jeſus give me a Portion and Intereſt in That, and diſpoſe of all other things with me as thou pleaſeſt in the mean while. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here can be properly called Happineſs or Miſery; for it may be rather termed a tranſient Delight, or ſmall Vexation, which as the ſhadow upon the top or ſurface of the Earth, preſently haſteth by; it may ſlightly affect the Imagination, or uppermoſt Thought; but it ſhould not reach, nor deſcend into the depth of the Heart; for that ſhould take Thought of greater Things than what are to be had here: Or rather conſider the Diſpoſal and Eſtabliſhment of them, and ſo likewiſe uſe them in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to things to come. Even according to the Law and Direction of the Moſt High God, and by obſerving the Commandments and Sayings of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Good God! what abundant Exhortation is there to this? How many Repetitions, Inculcations and Inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt there be, only to do what a Subject doth readily for his Prince, a Child for his Parent, and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant for his Maſter. Is not God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, greater and better to us, than any of theſe Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Shall we not get as much by his Service as by
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102492:117"/> theirs? <hi>Are not his Promiſes as ſure?</hi> And doth not his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward extend further? Is not his Work as excellent? And the things he hath ſaid as good and fit to be done? Yea, they are more agreeable and reaſonable than any thing we now do in this World. <hi>His Commandments are not grievous,</hi> but ſuch as may be performed, and there is a greater Benefit annexed to the doing of them than is to be had in the moſt generous and highly eſteemed Actions according to the World. For beſides many other Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, whatever is done here in order to the things here, is certainly and evidently determined within this ſhort Time; but for thoſe who ſhall do the Will of God, it is not yet known what their Recompence ſhall be. It is higher than the Heavens and reaches even to the Length of Eternity. It is revealed unto us in great and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Words' ſufficient to raiſe our utmoſt Affection, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and Endeavour. But we are further aſſured from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 4. that it is yet more than we can now expect or conceive, <hi>For the Son of Man ſhall come in the Glory of his Father with his Angels, and then he ſhall reward every Man according to his Works,</hi> Mat. 16. 27. This is told us before that we may prepare and fit our Works accordingly; that we may have a greater Meaſure and of the beſt Sort of Works, ſo we may know what we have to do, and alſo be diligent in the Exerciſe thereof. Firſt, not to ſpend our Money for that which is not Bread, nor yet our Labour for that which ſatisfieth not: Not to be only or principally buſied about vain and periſhing Things; which it is impoſſible they ſhould content or make happy, for they do not remain. To draw off from the things of this World, and to employ our Care and Labour about the things to come. And then we are to ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that we may underſtand rightly how we may have eternal Life, and put in through God's gracious Promiſes for the different Degrees of Glory, even according as we have more or leſs abounded in the Work of the Lord; ſo that we ſhould not be ſo much concerned how much Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs we ſhall have in this mean while, or what Miſery we are liable unto; but ſtill give heed and take care for that which is to come.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:102492:118"/>
               <p>As the future Life ſucceeds and is annexed to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life, ſo we ſhould not think of one without the other. For that is the general Fault and Miſtake, that we are ſo ſunk and confined within this Life that we have no conſtant Regard to that Life which is to come. We do wholly conſult for the preſent, to the Neglect and Unmindfulneſs of the future: Whereas if Conſideration be taken of both together, then we ſhall manage things rightly: And when there is any Contrariety and Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition between them, there always Preference ought to be had to the greater, for more Concern ought to be had for a Year than for a Minute only. The Diſproportion is much more in all the ſeveral Inſtances between the things of this Life and the other. Albeit, they are now at this preſent Time had or ſeen: And the others are fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be expected and beleived. But yet theſe things ſhall be paſt and utterly done away, when the others ſhall ever remain, It is evident we muſt all be taken away from the things of this World, and then the whole Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Buſineſs of our Life will ſeem and ſignifie no more than of the paſt Time already, as to which, how that is we can conceive in our Mind. But then comes Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when thoſe Thoughts, Words and Actions, which are over and almoſt forgotten, ſhall come to be examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Diſtribution ſhall be made accordingly.</p>
               <p>Then the Diſguizes and contrary Appearances of things ſhall be pulled off, and they ſhall be ſeen and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

What do contribute to our Welfare, and what do tend to our Hurt, and this is to be meaſured, not according to falſe Thought or wrong Apprehenſion, but from the very Reality and Event of things.

               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:102492:118"/>
               <p>The Purpoſe of God ſtand firm, and he will certainly bring it to paſs, though in the mean while, through the Wiles and Oppoſition of Satan, ſome things may ſeem to let and hinder: And they may at firſt ſeem to bring the contrary to what they ſhall end in at the laſt. When God promiſes, <hi>I will deliver him and Honour him, with long Life will I ſatisfie him and ſhew him my Salvation,</hi> Pſal. 91. 15, 16. He may at firſt ſeem to be delivered over to the Will of his Enemies, and be overwhelmed with Shame: He may do thoſe things, which in common Probability will endanger and ſhorten his Life, and to be eſteemed ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God and forſaken; ſo that he hath not then ſo full and clear a Diſcovery of the divine Will and Counſel. Now if we had Faith, Knowledge and Patience, as to believe, diſcern and quietly expect as much, then we might eaſily in the mean while ſubmit to Hardſhip, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience and Diſappointment, knowing aſſuredly that that there will be an expected End. And by this doing we ſhall lay in more Stock and Foundation for our real and enduring Happineſs, whilſt we cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nually ſtudy and labour that we may be accepted of and approved by God, but neglect or diſregard the Pain or Pleaſure of the preſent, but refer all to future and endleſs Life. <hi>Whilſt we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen, for the things which are ſeen, are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but the things which are not ſeen, are eternal.</hi> The firſt indeed are felt, we being now in the midſt of them; and we ſenſibly know that they are little, vain, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily paſſing away; for they are either taken from us, or we from them: So they are but temporal. But to the other we daily approach nearer, we now apprehend them by Faith and Reaſon; and bleſſed is he that ſeeks diligently, for there ſhall be a certain Performance and obtaining of them.</p>
               <p>It is the eaſieſt thing in the World to be underſtood and moſt reaſonable to be practiſed, that the leſs ſhould, give way to the greater, and we ſhould be moſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about that which is of moſt Importance to every one of us. And hereupon the things of God and our Univerſal
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:102492:119"/> Duty to him, have the Preference infinitely before all other things whatever. For conceive what is moſt highly eſteemed or ſought after amongſt Men. The higheſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, greateſt Riches, or the moſt valuable Pleaſures cannot hold the leaſt Competition with that Exaltation which we expect from our God, the Inheritance that fadeth nor away, reſerved in the Heavens for us, and that Fulneſ, of Joy and the Pleaſures which are at God's Right Hand for evermore.</p>
               <p>God firſt gives things in a leſſer Degree for our Trial; and then afterwards he adds that which is full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for our Crown and Reward. That by the lawful Uſe of the things which he hath allowed we may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and quietly wait till we ſhall be made moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py at laſt. There is a wanting of ſomewhat at preſent to prove whether we will reach after ſomewhat more in Luſt or forbidden things, there is a little Conſciouſneſs of Want as well as an Appearance of Good, whereon to ground the Temptation and Trial. There is an haſty Deſire and coveting which coveting which craves to be ſatisfied, which by giving way unto, is yet more urgent, as contrariwiſe it diminiſhes and ceaſes by Denial and croſſing of it. If we did throughly conſider how little there is in thoſe things when had, as alſo how ſmall Pain and Irkſomeneſs it is, when they are reſolutely denied: We ſhould more conſtantly keep within the Tenour and Bounds of Chriſtian Sobriety.</p>
               <p>We are now to receive things to the very full, for we are not as yet to come to the Marriage-Supper of the Lamb, nor to the Feaſt of fat things upon the Lees well refined: Neither ſhould we here expect a tarrying or ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dow; <hi>For we are not as yet come to the Reſt which the Lord our God hath promiſed.</hi> We muſt be content to be fed with Tears and Sorrow, having Hope and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to come to that Place where they ſhall be done away. If God doth at preſent <hi>Give us Tears in great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> he will at length make it up in as large a Cup of Conſolation and Rejoycing.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:102492:119"/>
               <p>Theſe three make up our Condition here, <hi>Sorrow, Joy, or Contentedneſs between them both,</hi> and in one or the other, we paſs all the Days of our Pilgrimage. The laſt is moſt deſirable, for its Conſtancy and Duration, for though we eagerly covet after Mirth and Delight, yet that is weariſome if had long together; as alſo Grief, if it is continually upon us, it ſinks down the Soul. Now indeed the Worſt may be born and ſubmitted unto, if it be in order to good things to come. <hi>If we ſow in Tears,</hi> ſo that <hi>we may reap in Joy;</hi> if we go on in our Way weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo that we may come again rejoycing and bringing our Sheaves with us. <hi>Here is the Faith and Patience of the Saints:</hi> Here ſeems to be the great Trial and Exerciſe of Mankind; becauſe they forego the good things of this Life, and ſubject themſelves unto the evil; they take up the Croſs here when as yet they do not ſee any thing more. They are not indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitably certain to the contrary; for often ſuch a Stagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Doubt doth return, that here is their All, that after this Space they ſhall be no more for ever: And therefore ſome think that if they are bereaved of this, they are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deprived of all. Or what is to ſucceed hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; They ſay, That is of doubtful Expectation; or If it is in a more particular Manner at God's Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, then he may with-hold his Hand and not ſeem to grant as he doth here. So that to renounce a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty for an Uncertainty, to expoſe himſelf to preſent and ſenſible Labour and Pain (when it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined) only for future and conceived Reſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, this doth not ſeem reconcileable with the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this world. But the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this World comes to nought,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 6. ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all this may be anſwered from the true Dictates of Wiſdom, and by reducing all to our ſelves. For it is evident that if we had all the good things of this Time, and we did both ſay, and alſo put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, <hi>Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eat, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102492:120"/> That can be no Happineſs which hath an End. And ſeeing that we have immortal Souls and returning Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as our Maker and Creator hath told and aſſured us, We muſt, or ſhould have ſomething to ſtand in ſtead when all theſe ſhall fail. It can be no loſs to miſs of theſe things; for if had, yet they certainly periſh, and come to nothing, and we die and go away utterly from them. Now if we were to be no more for ever, it would be almoſt the ſame thing, if we did appear here for a longer or ſhorter Space, ſeeing that at length it muſt be utterly determined, and come to an utter End. <hi>Remember how ſhort my Time is, wherefore haſt thou made all Men in vain?</hi> What great difference is between a quick, or more ſlow motion? When each paſſeth by, and is gone for ever. Wherefore came I forth into Light, to know Vanity, Sorrow, and Evil, nay, it ſeems better, the leſs abode we make with them. It is well that it paſſeth, and we muſt be taken away from it, or we ſhould be wearied therewith.</p>
               <p>Even this Knowledge and Tireſomeneſs doth point out ſomething more; for this is the <hi>earneſt Expectation of the Creature:</hi> Which muſt be after ſomething more, and alſo more excellent than what is had here. It hath likewiſe ſome, though an imperfect Apprehenſion thereof; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there could be no Deſire and Waiting. Thus is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced that Exhortation of our Saviour in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. from <hi>Verſ.</hi> 26. to the End. <hi>Therefore take no thought for your Life, what ye ſhall eat or what ye ſhall drink, is not the Life more than Meat;</hi> aod ſo in <hi>V.</hi> 32. it is inculcated, for after all theſe things do the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſeek. They know nothing more, no do they diſcern much more in Life than Meat, Drink and Raiment juſt to receive and uſe theſe things and riſe up to play. But <hi>ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs,</hi> for that is more and of longer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and this Life and the things thereof is only in order to that. A Space only to prove and ſee whether we will therein ſeek after Immortality and Glory. <hi>Sufficient unto the Day is the Evil thereof.</hi> It brings more Evil than Good;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102492:120"/> ſo it is not deſirable to live only for living ſake, but to do the Work which the Lord hath ſent us here to do.</p>
               <p>And yet ſuch is the falſe and contrary Practice of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, that they are more concerned hew it goes with this Moment and Inch of Time, than how it ſhall be with them throughout the whole Length of Eternity. They are wonderfully careful and afraid of loſing a little Good, and ſuffering ſome ſmall Evil at the preſent Time, then they are fearful leaſt they come ſhort of the true and enduring Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, and leaſt they fall into the Damnation of Hell. What means that greedy and earneſt catching at all the Pleaſure or Profit that can be had, and running away from all manner of Evil, without regard to the Means, whether they be ſinful or not? This is no Conſideration, or at leaſt no Hindrance to the doing as they liſt. Like natural Brute Beaſts, they are only mindful of what is juſt before them; but regardleſs of what is to ſucceed. They act perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and go juſt contrary to the Command and Counſel of our Lord and Saviour, for they take thought for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and think themſelves never ſufficiently diligent in making Preparation for the Reſidue of this Life, and how it ſhall go with them in the few remaining Days, but they do not ſtretch their Care ond Proviſion further, not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heed to be received up into the heavenly Kingdom when all theſe things ſhall fail. Nor do they learn and practiſe the Righteouſneſs thereof, which would ſtand in ſtead: Whereas Meat, Drink and Raiment are for the Body; but this Body ſhall at length drop from them, and they ſhall have no need thereof.</p>
               <p>One would admire how it comes to paſs that ſo much Time and Labour are ſpent about the things of this Life, as uſually is: When the Meat and Drink are ſoon recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Raiment is quickly put on: So that there is Time to ſpare to mind other things, but they do as it were procraſtinate and lengthen it out of ſet Purpoſe. They ſeek out for ſuperfluous and more than neceſſary things, and hope to have this for an Excuſe for not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one thing needful. Nay, who have thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things without their own Care and Labour, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:102492:121"/> have them brought to their Hand; yet theſe do rather conſume their precious Time in Sloth or ſinful Pleaſures, or hungry Recreations, or vain things. But they are not employed in the Work of the Lord, nor do they ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Pleaſures of his Houſe;</hi> nor yet do they contemplate and ſeek to get an Intereſt in the <hi>Subſtance of the things hoped for,</hi> which only are true and enduring. They have ſome Fancy or ſeeming Reaſon for their preſent Manner of Life. It hath a Shew of Pleaſure, Eaſe and Quietneſs; but the Chriſtian Courſe ſeems to them to meet with Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, Trouble, Hardſhip, and Diſturbance. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the former ſenſibly comes to nothing, and to the other is promiſed a great Reward and an exceeding Weight of Glory. But even now the idle or ſinful Life is vexatious or tireſome: It is accompanied with Reſtleſneſs and Diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, for the Mind of Man covets after ſomething more, and alſo hath Regret when he is not converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what he ought. The Mind ſoars up above theſe lower things, and though kept down or turned aſide thro' the Policy and Deceivableneſs of Satan, yet it is with Pain and Diſpleaſure. Thoſe many ſilent Thoughts and Upbraidings of Spirit, that ſelf-Indignation, the continual Fear and Doubt of Mind, as often as it conſiders of God above, or caſts a Glimpſe towards Eternity and future Life, there is Horror and ſtrange Amazement. Every one, nay the Worſt Sinner or prophane Perſon doth ſometimes think of theſe things: And even who is moſt ſunk into Earthlineſs or Ignorance, his Life is continual Wearineſs and Vexation. And they are willingly more cumbred with the things of this Life. They do of ſet Purpoſe give way to it and conſume the greater Part of their Time herein. Becauſe worldly Buſineſs is a Diverſion from that Sorrow and Fear of Soul which they would otherwiſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under. If we could bring out the ſeveral Things and Paſſages of their Life we ſhould diſcover the manifold Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of Ungodlineſs and Diſobedience even at this preſent Time, beſides the <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> which is now revealed from Heaven, and ſhall be executed upon the Guilty when the Lord cometh with Ten Thouſand of his Saints.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102492:121"/> But on the other Hand, in the ſeveral Steps of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Warfare there is Contentedneſs Peace, Hope and Aſſurance. It hath the Strength and Comfort of God at present, and alſo Application of the Promiſes, which ſhall be made good and fulfilled hereafter.</p>
               <p>The utmoſt that can be done in this vain Life, which paſſeth away as a Shadow, is but little; and if we can poſſibly do any thing for which we may have the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of our God, and obtain Good at the latter End, it it is highly worth our greateſt Pains and Labour. At is is better to have it hereafter than now at preſent; for (as hath been heretofore often obſerved) every thing had now, doth paſs away, but what is to be revealed hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doth ever remain. Certainly they have the beſt Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make the wiſeſt Choice, who are for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more durable things, who let the Shadow paſs by, but make ſure of the Subſtance; who are contented to foregoe ſome things, which may endanger or leſſen from their heavenly Inheritance. Nay, if it be ſtrictly and properly conſidered, there is no great Loſs or Suffering in this; for though the Means may be ſomewhat diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or taken away, yet our God, through his gracious and and bountiful Nature, by his wonderful and over-ruling Providence doth ſupply what is wanting; and he doth nevertheleſs give the thing it ſelf, for which the others are eſteemed neceſſary and ſought after. Such things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired in order to Contentment and preſent Happineſs; and again, we decline others, leſt they ſhould bring on Evil and Miſery. Now God (who maketh all things to work together for Good, to them that love and fear him) can, and alſo doth give the ſame Contentment without them; and alſo takes away, or ſoftens the pain when the nature of ſuch a thing would inflict it.</p>
               <p>And further, When we are in the way of certain Duty we have ſtrong Conſolation and Approbation of Mind, as we may know by the direction of God's Word, and ſenſibly by the Law written in our own Hearts. But hereby we may know if we do thoſe Things that are not
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102492:122"/> required, if they have no plain Footſtep or Warrant from the Word; as alſo, there is a wearineſs and doubt of Soul. A Man may run out of Breath in a wrong Road, or in a blind furious Zeal, but in keeping cloſe and diligent to the Lines of known Duty, there God gives Grace and Glory; the firſt to enable, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Encouragement and Recompence. <hi>And no good thing will he with-hold from them,</hi> that always act obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently to his Will. Indeed we may grow weary in Well-doing, through ſome Unbelief, or Diſtruſt of the after Recompence; and alſo at preſent we may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what fail, and be diſcouraged in our Mind, for want of that Succeſs and Event to our Labours, which we did before expect and deſire for. But we are only to put forth his Grace, and uſe all the outward means, and then commit the thing to God, that he may bring it to paſs. We may Plant or Water, but then we ſhould Pray, and leave it to God to give the Increaſe. <hi>Neither is he that Planteth any thing, nor he that Watereth, but God that giveth the Increaſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3 7. He ſuffereth us, as it were, to labour in vain, and to ſpend our Strength for nought, and in vain, that he may cut off all occaſion of boaſting from our ſelves, that we ſhould not aſcribe to our ſelves in any thing as if we did it.</p>
               <p>We do greatly err and miſtake, in reckoning upon Things being done more ſuddenly than they are; for in Planting and Watering, the growth and fruit are by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; nay, it firſt rots, and ſinks deeper, before it riſes up to ſpringing and increaſe. It may ſeem quite loſt and periſhed, until it appears forth viſible and great. <hi>Caſt thy Bread upon the Waters, for thou ſhalt find it after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days,</hi> Eccleſ. 11. 1. But in the mean while there may be ſorrow, vexation, and murmuring for fear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, leſt there ſhould no good come of it. God ſees all things at once, and knows the Things which are not yet, but will be; he ſpeaks of them before they are, yea, and declares them whileſt they are yet ſpringing forth. He doth give us gracious Promiſes and Aſſurance, That
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:102492:122"/> there ſhall be a bleſſed Effect at laſt, upon which we may even now Hope and Rely; notwithſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary things do happen, which may even tempt us to caſt away our confidence, unleſs we were foretold by him, whom we have all Reaſon to believe, <hi>That it hath a great Recompence of Reward.</hi> We do hardly gueſs aright at the things before us, as to the very nature and reaſon of them; but we know not at all of the things to come; for moſt commonly they happen contrary, but always otherwiſe than we did at firſt imagine. And whileſt we ſwell up big and high in expectation, the vexation is yet greater by a Diſappointment. There are many things in common Life, but much more in a Chriſtian Courſe, which raiſe the different Affections of Joy and Sorrow, which make us now to be <hi>lifted up,</hi> and then <hi>caſt down,</hi> Pſal. 102. 10. But between both extreams, and variety of condition, we may rub through, and go on ſtill, we may have reſpect unto all God's Statutes, obſerving all manner of Duty, and avoid all ſin of Omiſſion or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and ſubmit to our God for the Event of all. Whatever pain, doubt, fear, ſorrow, or any other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Evil we may meet with, yet all is ſuch that a Man armed with Grace may endure. <hi>For God will ſuffer none to be tempted above that he is able. Now for a ſeaſon (if need be) ye are in Heavineſs through manifold Temptations, That the trial of your Faith being more precious than of Gold that periſheth, might be found unto Praiſe, and Honour, and Glory, at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 6, 7. And ſo contrariwiſe, whatever Comfort or Good we ſhall receive at any time, we are to thank our God for it, and to go on more chearfully and diligently in all Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>This is the way to Happineſs, which will be ſooner thus attained, than it can be had in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or profit, pride or humour, in activity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout unneceſſary things, or by giving way to ſloth and eaſe. And becauſe the Reward ſhall be anſwerable, and proportioned to the work, uſe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:102492:123"/> thy utmoſt diligence in the mean while to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound more in well-doing, and lay up for thy ſelf a greater degree and foundation of good Works, againſt the time to come. Caſt about, and conſider throughly in thy mind, which way thou ſhalt moſt glorifie God, and do good to Mankind. And when thou haſt found out, or art directed in the right manner, then ariſe up, and be doing thereafter. Remember that thou doſt ſerve and labour for thy God, <hi>Whoſe Reward is with him, and his Work before him,</hi> Iſa. 40. 11. It ſhall be recompenced to thee much beyond what thou canſt do, though thou ſhouldeſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in his ſervice, every Hour and Minute of thy Life. Be not careful, or afraid, how much Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs thou ſhalt miſs of in the mean while, or what miſery thou Mayeſt involve thy ſelf in, or art liable unto, but truſt thy God, who ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly make up for all. Men may (for there are found thoſe which actually do) <hi>go through the ſeveral changes and chances of this mortal life;</hi> and yet they have no ſuch expectation to come. So that we may keep Innocency, and take heed unto the thing which is right all along; for it will give peace at the laſt, which is further conſummated in Eternal Glory. We ſhould not confer with Fleſh and Blood, which is for preſent eaſe, and ſhrinks at the leaſt ſeeming pain, but immediately do the thing we are called unto. Neither ſhould we ſtand to examine the Events and Conſequents to our ſelves, but reſolutely do our Duty, come what will thereof. <hi>And whatever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto Men, knowing that of the Lord ye ſhall receive</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:102492:123"/> 
                  <hi>the Reward of the Inheritance; for ye ſerve the Lord Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3. 23, 24. In each ſingle Action let the Intention be unto God: Even thoſe things which we do for one another, may be ordered and ſtretched up, that we may always conſider how we ſhall Glorifie and Pleaſe God hereby. As of Sin the Act is little and ſoon paſſeth over, ſo the Act of Duty is ſomewhat longer, but may be performed, and then this alſo is paſſed by; but of both the Guilt and Expectation doth ſtick and remain, the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Reward are to come. And alſo the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſenſible Good or Evil, do ſooner go away than the Morning Dew, and ſignifieth nothing at all afterwards. So that it cannot be ſaid or pronounced, What Man is Happy or Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but he is only to be denominated and found thus, as it ſhall be with him in the things to come. Envy thou not the Glory of a Sinner, for thou knoweſt not what ſhall be his End. Neither do thou Pity and be grieved at the poor and low Eſtate of God's Faithful People, for thou doſt not diſcern how Graciouſly he will be pleaſed to deal with them at the laſt. When the Lord comes to rehearſe up his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to make Reſtitution and Diſpenſation of all things, then this Man ſhall be pronounced Bleſſed and another Accurſed, though this laſt whilſt he lived, he counted himſelf an Happy Man, and the other's Life was eſteemed Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his End without Honour.</p>
               <p>Our Reaſon and Underſtanding can fetch in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:102492:124"/> things afar off, and make them ſeem all one as if they were near: We can conceive of things Future, as if they were already Preſent: That as we know we ſhould do, and as even then we ſhall verily and indeed wiſh we had done. That we ſhould ſo behave our ſelves in the midſt of our Trial, as we ſhall deſire we had done when we come to an Account, and it ſhall be rendred to every one according to his Deeds. We are upon our Good Behaviour all this mean while. And as it was ſaid to <hi>Cain</hi> immediately before his Wicked Fact, ſo it is told to every one of us, before we enter upon the Actions of our Life, <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doſt not well, Sin lieth at the door,</hi> Gen. 4. 7. Accordingly from Time to Time, we are to lay hold of every Opportunity for well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, and as carefully avoid the Occaſions of all manner of Evil.</p>
               <p>This is repeated over again, for indeed it had need be as often inculcated, as <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> doth repeat over and over again to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> God's Law, for them to obſerve and do it. <hi>To write the ſame things over again unto Good Minds is not Grievous;</hi> but <hi>to them it is Safe.</hi> And though it may ſeem nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous and irkſome to the Evil and Ungodly, ſo it would be but once to mention what they have no Mind to know, and no Heart to do. All is compriſed in the Obſervation of God's Law, and it is of Abſolute and Indiſpenſable Neceſſity, ſo that it can never be preſſed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:102492:124"/> too much. We ſhould have it always in our Remembrance; and as it ſhould be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ingrafted in us, ſo it ſhould ſtir up and be continually ſenſible in our Minds, that we may know how to act, and have wherewithall to anſwer every Temptation, and drawing aſide to Evil; and alſo have that which would quicken and actually ſtir us up unto Good.</p>
               <p>The World makes enquiry, and ſeems to be deſirous after Good; and when it is pointed out, and ſhewed unto them, they will not accept and imbrace it: This is not the ſort they would have, or it is too High and Excellent for them, through Ignorance they do not deſire it. They are for abundance of Corn and Wine, or for Carnal and Senſual Pleaſure; but for the Light of God's Countenance, for that Gladneſs he puts into the Heart, for Spiritual Joy and Eternal Peace; Theſe things the Worldly Man knoweth not, neither doth he apprehend the juſt Worth and Excellency in them: But a little outward Mirth, in the midſt whereof the Heart is Sorrowful, or ſudden Flaſhes of Rejoycing, which end in Darkneſs, this is what he doth catch and ſeek after. A Thouſand or Ten thouſand repeated Acts of this Nature, do not make up the True Happineſs; for each is unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory at the very time, it is interrupted, and all determined at laſt. In Truth, None is to be blamed for endeavouring to make his Life as Comfortable as he can, for paſſing on theſe few and evil Days of his Pilgrimage with the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:102492:125"/> leſſer Trouble and Sorrow. But in the mean while great Heed and Care ſhould be taken, as to the Means, whither Sinful or not; and ſo whither ſeveral parts of Duty are not left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done upon this Pretext. If we do <hi>fulfil all Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>walk in all the Commandments of the Lord Blameleſs;</hi> If we do take heed to our ways, that we Offend or Sin not, in God's Name let us rejoyce our ſelves as much as we will. If we <hi>Sanctifie the days of our Feaſting,</hi> and uſe our utmoſt Watchfulneſs and Circumſpection that <hi>we Sin not, nor Curſe God in our Hearts,</hi> Job 1. 5. becauſe he doth not allow it to be ſo with us always, then we are to Praiſe our God, and we may give way unto Honeſt Mirth and Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: And ſo in the other extream Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, If in Cold and Nakedneſs, Hunger and Thirſt, we can Bleſs our God and be contented, let us truſt him further, whither he will not bring us to True and Enduring Happineſs.</p>
               <p>Whilſt others are buſied, and converſant only about the Preſent, let us look out to the End: Nay, Let us ſecure that, and then let the Preſent take care for the things of it ſelf. Shall we make it an Article or Doubt, Whither we ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſet upon the keeping of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, for fear of loſing ſo much Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Eaſe in the mean while, and ſubjecting our ſelves to Pain and Irkſomneſs. Know we not, that if it were ſo, our God will abundantly make up for all by his Recompence at the laſt, as he doth give an Earneſt, by the Sweetneſs and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:102492:125"/> Comfort we perceive even now: For if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that Approbation of Mind, that ſtrong Conſolation and lively Hope, and take in one thing with another, we have more Good now, than poſſibly could be attained by any Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Diſobedience. It is both agreeable and ſatisfactory to our Nature, if we reflect upon it according to Truth, and without its Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for God who made us, and knoweth our Frame, hath fitted his Laws and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments accordingly. What the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I had not known Sin but by the Law, for I had not known Luſt, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not Covet,</hi> Rom. 7. 7. So in not a much unlike manner it may be applied, That if we did throughly know the very Nature of Sin and Luſt, we ſhould not ſo much give way or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto either; for that which led our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers into the Tranſgreſſion, is the ſame that doth entice us at this very day. <hi>The Woman ſaw that the Tree was good for Food, and that it was pleaſant to the Eyes, and a Tree to be deſired to make one Wiſe,</hi> Gen. 3. 6. Here was an Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Good, Pleaſure,</hi> and of <hi>bettering</hi> ones pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State; and this prevailed to yield unto the Temptation. Now if more of each ſort of all theſe three, were to be had by keeping within that Station and Bounds God hath ſet, then a meer Selfiſh and Wiſe Man knoweth what he hath to do. Nay, there is each of this ſort to be had in the other Trees of the Garden. God hath already ſufficiently provided for the well-being
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:102492:126"/> of Mankind in the lawful uſe of thoſe things he hath given; and it is known unto God, and we are to wait his good Pleaſure, what he will do yet further for his Creatures. He gives us all things richly and ſufficiently to enjoy, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from nothing which is really Good and Profitable for us. Nay, <hi>Luſt</hi> and <hi>Coveting</hi> is but an Extravagant and Unreaſonable Deſire, for we had enough before, and whatever is more is Evil.</p>
               <p>If we did inſtance in the ſeveral kinds of Sin, with the way how they did prevail over Man, we ſhould find that it did proceed from a wrong and falſe Imagination of more Good than really is therein; and they make a ſhew of Happineſs which they do not perform. All thoſe Works of the Fleſh, recited in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19, 20, 21. carry with them a little Pleaſure, ſeeming Good and Advantage, which are thought neceſſary to make Man Happy. So Covetouſneſs, with its ſeveral kinds of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Wrong, do promiſe Gain and Profit, which likewiſe are ſuppoſed to contribute unto the ſame end. The like may be obſerved of Pride and Vain Glory, and all other kinds of Evil; they come in to Pleaſe and Gratifie, or they are ſome ways eſteemed convenient. Now Happineſs is the End, and more than all theſe put together; but they are ignorantly and falſly judged, as ſeveral parts to conſtitute unto the whole, and that each doth conduce ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what toward it.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:102492:126"/>
               <p>Herein may be perceived the Uſefulneſs and Excellency of a right and thorough Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for that apprehends the ſame thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which the Man is fully convinced of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by Practice and Experience. If he comes to Repentance (otherwiſe he is Damned and Miſerable.) This includes hearty Sorrow and Shame for what is paſt, and a real unfeigned Reſolution to do ſo no more. Seeing he now knows it to be as it is, he doth really and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely wiſh that he had never done it, and he is fully reſolved not to do ſo any more. It is truly ſaid, a Wiſe Man ſhould never do any thing to repent of it, for he ſhould know before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand what would be the evil Conſequent of ſuch a thing, and this ſhould oblige him at firſt to refrain and not to do it. Now all of us ſhould firſt look up, and have reſpect unto God above, and conſider how that we are Creatures under him, and we ſhould obey him and keep his Commandments, which extend unto all that we have here to do in this World. And we may thus judge, either this is reaſonable and fit to be done, or it is not. No Man dare or will deny, that God is to be obeyed, and that preſently and at all Times: Neither can they gainſay, but that his Commandments are <hi>Holy, Just</hi> and <hi>Good;</hi> which if <hi>a Man do, he ſhall even live by them.</hi> They are ſuitable unto and preſerve our Nature, and lead up unto Eternal Life and Bleſſedneſs. Now this may be diſcerned at firſt as well as at laſt. And ſo he may conclude it both reaſonable, and make it his actual deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:102492:127"/> Choice to obſerve them, <hi>I have Sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy Righteous Judgments,</hi> Pſal. 119. 106. And if this be done at firſt, there is no need of Repentance. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly better to Sin not than to have ſinned; for otherwiſe thoſe many Commands, Cautions and Directions in Scripture, of <hi>abſtaining from all appearance of Evil,</hi> would not have been for our Good. So he is in the more Happy Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who hath kept himſelf Innocent all along, according to the Tenor of Goſpel. Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who never did continue in Sin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot ſo properly turn from, or repent of it.</p>
               <p>This is the thing which God requires of Man, is well pleaſed with him now, and will reward him hereafter: That he ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, and fully apprehend God's ways, and alſo walk in them: That he ſhould make his word the conſtant Rule of his Actions, to do thus becauſe of ſuch a Commandment or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and again to refrain from that which is either Forbidden or Doubtful, or doth no ways tend to God's Glory. In whatever he takes in hand, to have a ſecret Reſpect unto God's Statutes, according to which he will live, and act, and <hi>ſuffer, that the Lord ſhall guide him continually,</hi> and then be ſure to follow his Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance If the Man is indeed perſwaded that it is better for him thus to do, he will alſo ſincerely endeavour to do thereafter; for there are ſo many things which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urge to this, that whoſo conſiders, muſt act accordingly. In the ſeveral
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:102492:127"/> times of Trial and Deliberation, he might thus Reaſon within himſelf, which is better and ſafer to be done, Had I not better wait on and ſeek after the Lord than let it alone? If I ſhould neglect at this Moment, ſhall I not hereafter wiſh that I had not neglected? Will not an Hour and ſo of the reſidue of my Time ſpent in the Service of God, turn to better account, than if the ſame had been laviſhed away in Sloath or Neglect, impertinent Buſineſs or Vain Pleaſures, or in hungry Recreations? And ſo, would it not be better accepted with God, if I were governed by his Commandments, than if I did walk after mine own Thoughts, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to mine own Stubborn Will, or Vain Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? All that we have already is from God, and therefore Thankfulneſs doth oblige to as much; and what we expect further is from him; and then Hope, and a due Preparation for our ſelves, do forcibly exhort to Duty.</p>
               <p>We are now in an imperfect and wanting Condition, which deſires for what is Perfect and Compleat; and of whom ſhould we ſeek for this, but of the God who made us, he alſo hath promiſed, that he will perfect that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth us, <hi>Thy Mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever: Forſake not the Works of thine own hands,</hi> Pſal. 138. 8. What did move him at firſt to Create, the ſame doth continue, and will engage to add yet more, until he hath finiſhed the Work in <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Happineſs.</hi> But he will be ſought unto, and alſo we muſt endeavour to pleaſe him before he grant this thing, <hi>The Lord is good</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:102492:128"/> 
                  <hi>to them that wait for him, to the Soul that ſeeketh him,</hi> Lam. 3. 25. All the things of this World cannot make a Man Happy, for they are not ſatisfactory, nor yet enduring. The firſt would be more perceived, if Men were not after the manner of Beaſts, transformed into Sloth and Stupidity, or ſunk into groſs Darkneſs and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: The latter is ſenſibly felt by every one. Neither the Pleaſures of Sin, nor Profits of Tranſgreſſion, nor the ſeeming Eaſe or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Irreligion and Ungodlineſs, not each ſingly, nor yet all put together, can give the true Happineſs; therein is eſteemed more Good than really is; and if it were not ſo much as imagined, yet even that could not render ſatisfied and truly Bleſſed. Nay contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, Deſtruction and Miſery are in their ways, and the way of Peace they have not known. It is a Deviation and Wandring from the way of Salvation and Happineſs: It may for a while promiſe Safety and Pleaſure, but doth lead into Danger and Puniſhment, as we are aſſured by that God who made and knows all things.</p>
               <p>If ſuch a thing doth certainly deprive of more Good, and involve into a greater Evil, than now it makes a Pretence to bring or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from, a Man who is endued but with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Underſtanding and Caution for himſelf, knows what he hath to do, even to decline and avoid that thing as is ordinarily done in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Matters. If you do but ſtretch this very ſame Principle of acting a little further than this preſent Time, and it will engage to renounce
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:102492:128"/> thoſe very things, which others ſo greedily catch and ſeek after. We are but in a Maze and ignorant Perplexity, whilſt we look after, or are ſwayed by the Effects and Conſequences of things; for we may indeed imagine, but we know not what they will be; and by vain Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Fears, we may be kept off from doing Righteous things and what we ought. But let us firſt mind what is written, How readeſt thou? And in Simplicity of Soul, and according to the beſt of our Knowledge, How underſtandeſt thou? And according to what the Lord Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or Directs in his Word, ſo will we ſpeak and do. Shewing our ſelves as obedient Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and then let the Lord to do with us as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him good: Obſerving all manner of Duty, come what will thereof, <hi>They that know thy Name will put their Truſt in thee, for thou, Lord, haſt not forſaken them that ſeek thee,</hi> Pſal. 9. 10. Were we aſſured of this, and could we fully depend upon it, we ſhould not uſe irregular or unlawful means to prevent at firſt, nor afterwards to be relieved out of our Diſtreſſes. Neither ſhould we ſo much fail and be diſcouraged in our Mind; but be ſure not to leave off waiting on the Lord. Did we verily and undoubtedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eve at firſt what the Lord will perform at laſt, with what Chearfulneſs and Activity ſhould we go on? But the clear Manifeſtation of this is ſomewhat hidden and concealed from us, to exerciſe our Faith and Truſt, and to prove our Obedience in the mean while.</p>
               <p>We ſhould always act by foregoing
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:102492:129"/> Thought, even in the leaſt and more Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Actions of our Life; and at every time have a right Knowledge, and alſo an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Thought, which ſhould actually incline us to the better and ſafer ſide; That our Hearts may be as the <hi>Vineyard of our Lord,</hi> which he will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ter every Moment with the continued Diſtillings of his Grace and Goodneſs, which may prevent and help againſt the Suggeſtions and Imaginations of Sin and Evil; and it may be throughly <hi>applied to fulfil thy Statutes, always even unto the End.</hi> If God ſuffers us ſometimes to be in Temptation, we ſhould conſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern when we are ſo; and have a Thought continually, whereby we may overcome, and not be led away by it. If we can come off Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors at one time, why not at another, and ſo a third; and thus paſs through the ſeveral Seaſons of Trial. The thing is poſſible, and that Satisfaction of Mind of reſiſting the Temptation is much greater than the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure would have been in yielding unto it. By what Thought of Good thou didſt prevail at one time, thou mayſt likewiſe at another; and in all the Queſtions and Doubts of Mind, thou mayſt have ſtill what ſhall determine thee to God and Duty. When thou doſt well and rightly, Thank thy God for it, and keep this ſtill in the Imagination of thy Heart, that it may again help to ſerve in time of Need and Trial; having always in Mind a Divine over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Thought, which may actually perſwade it againſt all manner of Temptation, Luſt or Hindrance.</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:102492:129"/>
               <p>The <hi>Moraliſt</hi> obſerves, that it is better to have a few good Precepts of Life for a Man to conſtantly act by, than a great multitude of them; for thoſe are more eaſily retained in Mind, whereas a Multiplicity doth confound or perplex, or we let them ſlip, or each hath not ſo forcible a Conſtraint over us. And indeed a few right Principles of Good, which are kept continually and pondered in the Heart, which are general and extend to our ſeveral Actions, and will indeed engage our Practice according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Theſe will more help to our Salvation, than all the Variety of Knowledge; which laſt may indeed furniſh the Underſtanding, but the practical part doth exerciſe unto Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and preſerves the patient Continuance in well-doing. What keeps in Obedience, and maintains Good Works, will be found more Uſeful and Beneficial to Mankind than any other thing, However it be <hi>highly eſteemed amongſt Men,</hi> and this is leſſened and deſpiſed, for it obtains the greater Good, and ſerves to the more excellent End.</p>
               <p>The great Matter is to rightly underſtand every tittle of our Duty now that we may do it, and alſo the manner of Diſtribution, how it ſhall be rendred to every one according to his Work at the end of things, that we may not loſe any future Reward for the preſent Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Sin or Gains of Unrighteouſneſs, or by any Omiſſion of what we ſhould do. To know the utmoſt in all things preſent, and have ſuch a lively Faith in things to come, as
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102492:130"/> to be <hi>perſwaded of them, and embrace them,</hi> Heb. 11. 13. and alſo act in purſuance after them. We are as much aſſured as that we now live, and we have the ſame certainty as of the things we ſee, handle and converſe withall, that God hath provided better things for us; even ſo very great and enduring, that it is not poſſible for us little and mortal Creatures to conceive. Nay, the little member of the Tongue, which boaſts of great things, cannot utter them forth to the very extent and reality as they are; and they being reſerved in God's hand and diſpoſal, according to his good Word and precious Promiſes, wherefore we labour to the utmoſt that we may be accepted of him. The more we know of our preſent weak, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, imperfect and miſerable Condition here in the Body, it doth preſs us more urgently ſo to have our Converſation in this World, that it may be changed into the contrary and deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Qualities of Good and Perfection. Our manifold Affliction doth make us the more earneſtly deſire (and that is in vain unleſs we uſe the means accordingly) that we may come to that place where we ſhall be comforted for the evil things we had here. Every thing we meet withal, doth carry Inſtruction and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, if we had that Heavenly and Spiritual Art to obſerve and improve them accordingly. That we may be always put in remembrance of and quickened in our Duty. That whilſt we are among the things here below, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them all upwards. Though our Body is
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:102492:130"/> confined to this place, yet our Spirit conceives as wide as the vaſt Air. The Mind conceives and enters within the Vail, and is always think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the time ſhe ſhall fly out hence, how ſhe may ſecure her Reſt there: <hi>If I may by any means attain to the Manſions above.</hi> I am contented to act or ſuffer any thing, ſo I may be received up into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom. <hi>And he ſaw that Reſt was good, and the Land that it was pleaſant,</hi> Gen. 49. 15. Seeing that there is ſuch an exceeding Good ſet before us, ſhew us any way that we may come at it. <hi>What ſhall I do to be Saved?</hi> I am for looking out whether there is any thing more: And I am ſtill for giving Diligence, how I may make my Calling and Election more ſure; for ſuch an infinite and eternal Good cannot poſſibly be made too ſure of; and this ſhould ſtir up all Labour, Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Care, till we be actually inveſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. <hi>Be Sober, be Vigilant, for your Adverſary the Devil walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> He watcheth for an Opportunity to turn you aſide, and if poſſible, to deprive you of your Acceptation and Reward, but however of ſuch a part and degree thereof, that you may loſe ſomewhat of the <hi>Things you have wrought,</hi> 2 <hi>John</hi> 8. and ſo you miſs of that fullneſs of Reward, which otherwiſe you might have been a partaker thereof. And therefore know and make void his Devices, that you may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hindred or deceived by him. There is that in the Chriſtian Life, which will exerciſe all our Time and Labour. As Servants are
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:102492:131"/> employed all the day in the Work of their Maſter, and as a Maid doth continually attend upon the Buſineſs of her Miſtreſs, ſo we are to <hi>wait on the Lord all the day,</hi> Pſal. 25. 5. and to <hi>be in the fear of the Lord all the day long,</hi> Prov. 23. 17. When the Child Jeſus was carefully ſought by his Parents according to the Fleſh, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to their Admiration, <hi>Wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my Fathers buſineſs,</hi> Luke 2. 49. and in another place he ſaith, <hi>I have Meat to eat that ye know not of,</hi> John 4. 32. And when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the Saying, he explains it, <hi>My Meat is to do the Will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his Work,</hi> Verſe 34. So likewiſe as we have him for our Lord, we are to obey his Will; and as we have him for our Example, we are to do as he did; as he laid the Foundation, ſo we are to build thereon: As Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth ſay, in reference to him who is the Great Lord over all, <hi>My God and your God, My Father and your Father:</hi> So likewiſe he hath committed to every one of us as Servants and Children ſome work to do, for the Glory of our Maſter and Father which is in Heaven. The great King hath committed to every one of us, ſome Gifts and Talents to be occupied in the mean while, till he ſhall come to require an Account. Obedience to his Laws, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our Grace and Knowledge to the utmoſt Advantage, will take up what Time and Leiſure we have here, if it were more than rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly it is: To keep the Heart with all Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, To receive all God's Words into it,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:102492:131"/> To have them appear forth and be ſenſible, that the Man may always do accordingly; To bring them forth for the Edifying and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of others: To grow in Grace and Knowledge, <hi>till the Man of God is throughly furniſhed for every Good Word and Work,</hi> and many other things of like nature will take up that ſpace here on Earth, which is lent unto Man to underſtand and ſeek after his God. And the time thus expended will turn to better account than any thing which can be thought of or named under the Sun.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Make thou thy Servant to delight in that which is Good.</hi> Which is accordingly granted by Cuſtom and Continuance in the ſame. That Self-ſufficiency and Contentedneſs doth ariſe from God and Duty. The Meditation of him is Sweet, and there is Joy and Satisfaction in doing his Will. So that the Man who is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed therein, doth not envy nor is troubled for the ſeeming Proſperous Condition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but he is rather grieved that they alſo do not come, and <hi>taſte and ſee that the Lord is Good: Bleſſed is the Man that truſteth in him,</hi> Pſal. 34. 8. Our ſelves (the Lord is Witneſs, who knoweth all that is in the Hearts of all the Children of Men are chiefly <hi>grieved</hi> becauſe <hi>People do always err in their Heart,</hi> Heb. 3. 10. That whilſt they deſire and ſeek for it in every thing beſides, they will not be perſwaded nor truſt accordingly, that this Happineſs is to be had in God only; That they will not come over to partake of his
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:102492:132"/> Goodneſs. When they have at any time right inclinations and diſpoſitions to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, this one thing is needful, that they would but <hi>continue</hi> the ſame, <hi>O that there was ſuch an Heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my Commandments always, that it may be well with them, and with their Children for ever,</hi> Deut. 5. 19. To keep all his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments always doth begin their Happineſs here, which is continued as long as they are on this Earth; it is derived down to their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and is for ever conſummated in the Heavens.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to be a plain and poſitive Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt, that it ſhall be <hi>well with Mankind to keep all his Commandments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.</hi> But it is contrary to our Thoughts, for we often think it expedient to break and not to give heed unto them; but yet God is True, tho every Man is Wicked and Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient. What he hath ſaid, he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and it ſhall be fulfilled, tho we are apt to diſtruſt and Murmur. Thoſe Irregular thoughts and our other Sins do hinder that it is not ſo well with us, as it would be otherwiſe. <hi>If we did wait on th Lord and keep his way,</hi> Pſal. 37. 34. Do his will and <hi>Truſt in him at all times,</hi> Pſal. 62. 8. Believe in him without wavering and doubt, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly and cheerfully might we go on in the execution of thoſe things he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us? If we did reſolutely and vigorouſly put forth, uſing the right and good means,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:102492:132"/> we might behold Satan falling from Heaven as Lightning, and the Spirits would be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto us. This would be no ſmall Comfort, for they do hinder and defeat our good Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. But then we ſhould further rejoice <hi>that our Names are written in Heaven,</hi> That we are Servants of Almighty God, That we fulfil all his will and do his pleaſure. What pleaſeth our God to command or direct us in that we are likewiſe pleaſed to do. when we have a frame and temper of Spirit Subject to his Will, when our Hearts are once conformed to his Word and Commandments, we may ſerve him with joyfulneſs and gladneſs of mind. When we conſider diligently what he doth already give and provide for us. When we believe firmly what he hath further promiſed, when we obſerve narrowly the ſecret and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ways of his overruling Providence, how that all things ſo work that we may juſt perform our Duty and be comforted in the mean while: So that it is well and better with us, than with them who flouriſh and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe moſt in worldly Goods. May we not more ſurely rely upon God's infallible VVord that it ſhall be well with us, than the vain and deceitful Promiſes of others, or our own Imaginations in our own Deſigns and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, for we know by experience that we are often beguiled and miſtaken as to both; but the Lord never ſaid to the Houſe of <hi>Jacob, Seek ye my face in vain.</hi> Neither is he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as ſome are apt to doubt) to make good
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:102492:133"/> his Promiſes at the preſent time. But they do err in miſapprehending of them; for the great and precious Promiſes are yet a far off. And now the Divine Goodneſs is only engaged ſo far as to give us all things pertaining to Life and Godlineſs, to preſerve Health and Strength of Body; and he puts Grace and <hi>Conſolation</hi> into the Soul that we may Perform. And if we are at any time caſt down, yet we ſhould not then be ſo diſcouraged as to neglect utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and leave from Duty. In the name of God let us go on and take whatever we ſhall meet withal, for the time is ſhort and haſteneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. VVnither we Rejoice or Rejoice not, whether we Laugh or Mourn, whether we are in good plight and ſteadfaſtneſs of Mind, or are heavy and caſt down, It all goes on and we flie away. And whatever is done here it is for Eternity. Either it paſſes into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, or it makes way for Repentance. <hi>There is one Event to him that Sacrificeth or him that Sacrificeth not,</hi> and this is found ſo by daily Experience. But the ſame word of Truth ſaith, <hi>That we muſt appear before the Judgment Seat of Chiſt to receive for the things we have done whether they be Good or Evil.</hi> It is certain that the <hi>Lord God of Recompences ſhall ſurely requite,</hi> Jer. 51. 56. And this will much exceed both as to the delightful or torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature, whatever is eſteemed ſo here. The Acts are ſuddenly over, and ſo the Joy or Sorrow of of them is ſuddenly ſlipt by. And indeed it is ſtrange that a reaſonable
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102492:133"/> Creature ſhould be ſo much concerned as to that fugitive thing of Joy or Sorrow; but his care and ſollicitation ſhould be to what it tends at laſt. Nothing is ſo good as to be truly deſirable, and nothing is ſo bad but what may be endured. And therefore the firſt is not to be eagerly catched after, but to be carefully avoided if it ſhould lead and beguile into Miſery; and likewiſe the other may be choſen and ſubmitted unto if it makes for and increaſes our Crown and Reward. I mean as to the Delights and Pleaſures of Sin, ſo of the ſeeming pain and trouble of Duty. The firſt are nevertheleſs to be abſtained from, the others to be willingly undertaken if they help unto good in the latter end. And tho this may ſeem harſh and uncouth at firſt, yet it is both Practicable and eaſie to him who is exerciſed therein. It is thus by cuſtom and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and afterwards it grows up into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and ſincere Satisfaction. Notwithſtanding all vain fears and ſurmiſes, anxious care or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſtruſt, yet by thus doing he ſhall have more Happineſs, yea, and be ſenſible of leſs Miſery even as to this preſent time, than poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the one can be had or the other avoided by all Irreligion, or the pretended wiſdom and caution of any Diſobedience.</p>
               <p>Much more might be ſaid as to this Point. But as the <hi>truth</hi> may be cleared, ſo again the force and perſwaſion thereof may be loſt by multiplicity of words, and therefore it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to add no more upon this particular Head of Diſcourſe, eſpecially there having
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:102492:134"/> been ſo much demonſtrated in the fore-cited Book of <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and as to the ſeveral Heads of Good and Evil there treated of, ſo that he who will not perceive nor be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by what hath been already ſaid, neither would he be perſwaded if <hi>ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand words</hi> were more added to the ſame purpoſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Herein ſundry Things are written againſt them who will not be perſwaded by, nor live according to Words; and alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt following the Multitude.</head>
               <p>BUT why do I mention this? <hi>In vain is the Pen of the Writer</hi> or the Tongue of the Speaker; for ſome obſtinate and ſtubborn Souls do therefore refuſe it. They will not be tied and confined to live according to Words; either they will be deſpiſers or ſtubborn, not to mind at all, or practice juſt contrary, or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Indeed one would admire by what kinds of method Satan's Kingdom doth ſtand; by what ſlender Threads he holds Men Captive at his will; for do but once examin and touch them, and they will fall and ſnap aſunder. Thoſe Imaginations which he puts into the Hearts of Men and Women, and thereby works in them with all deceivea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs; yet when they are once known they are preſently confuted. The falſhood
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:102492:134"/> and danger of them are ſo clearly laid open that themſelves may ſee it; and ſo they need not miſcarry through all his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, if they would but receive the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth that they might be Saved.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the ſeveral things which Satan, <hi>Who deceives the whole World,</hi> Rev. 12. 9. doth ſuggeſt, and each Man keeps cloſe in the deep of his Heart. That aforementioned is a common and generally received Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they hug and hold faſt! And to confirm them the more therein, they will have a ſeeming excuſe for it, becauſe ſo many go about troubling Chriſtians with Words, and there is ſuch a multitude of words in the World, ſuch hold it the better way once for all to reject them, and not to be limited or confined to live according to Words. But they ſhould do well in the firſt place, to conſider what it is they thus ſet at naught and caſt off even what they ſhall not proſper nor be bleſſed in, <hi>Their root ſhall be as rottenneſs, and their bloſſom ſhall go up as duſt, becauſe they have cast away the Law of the Lord of Hoſts, and deſpiſed the word of the holy one of</hi> Iſrael, Iſa. 5. 24. Theſe are the words which they will not be guided by, nor give heed unto. They refuſe obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto Almighty God, juſt like their fore Fathers, <hi>A ſtubborn and rebellious Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that kept not the Covenant of God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed towalk in his Law,</hi> Pſal. 78. 10. <hi>They</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:102492:135"/> 
                  <hi>rebelled againſt the words of God and contemned the Counſel of the most High,</hi> Pſal 107. 111. Now theſe words of God are contained in Scripture, which is his Statute-Book for his government of the World. <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16. As ſaith another Apoſtle, <hi>For the Prophecy came not in old time by the will of Man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 21. At this the People are ſo impatient and will not be governed by it, which is downright Diſobedience and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Sin, and ſhall receive a due Puniſhment thereof; for Sin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law, either going over and beyond it, or doing otherwiſe than that hath preſcribed, or not doing what that hath enjoyned. So that thoſe ſtubborn Souls who will not live according to Words, are convinced as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors and offenders of the Law of the moſt high God, and they ſhall be dealt with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, for now they are under the Threatning and Curſe, and they ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be ſenſible of the Puniſhment and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. Who is he that ſaith, he will not obey the Law of God? If any ſhould do ſo as to the Laws of the King and our Country, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be executed upon him of Death or Baniſhment, or loſs of Liberty or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, according to the ſeveral ſorts of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among us. And albeit our God doth keep Silence for a while, and doth not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Sentence ſpeedily upon the Sons of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:102492:135"/> Men, yet it will be far worſe with them who ſhall thus behave themſelves towards the great King of all the Earth, the Lord God Almighty. It is near the ſame thing whether they ſpeak out with a loud voice, or ſay ſo in their Heart, or practice it in their Life and Manners, that <hi>They will not have God to reign over them.</hi> ſee Luke 19. 14. <hi>Who ſet themſelves againſt the Lord and againſt his Anointed,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Let us break their bands aſunder and caſt away their Cords from us,</hi> Pſal. 2. 2, 3. For they will not be holden in by inviſible Reſtraints, nor be kept away from their own doings by ſenſe of any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law and Obligation. <hi>Our lips are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi> Pſal. 12. 4 But thoſe who think and act after this manner are the worſt ſort of Sinners, who do preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſin with an high Hand. Few will own as much, though more do ſo.</p>
               <p>The general courſe of Tranſgreſſion is by way of Excuſe and Deluſion, and theſe do take up the forementioned Plea, That becauſe of the multitude of Words, and the falſhood, Vanity and Evil of many of them, therefore they do not live according to Words. But as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There are it may be ſo many kinds of Voices in the World, and none of them is without ſignification,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 10. So a Word is but as it were a Voice expreſſed and articulated. And every word (if it be proper and taken ſingly) is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative, but when they are connected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:102492:136"/> in a Sentence, and are to ſhew forth the ſenſe and meaning of ſomewhat, then they are to be judged of and diſcerned. There is <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Fulſhood, right Words</hi> and <hi>wrong.</hi> But we ſhould in no wiſe reject the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi> becauſe there are of the other worſe ſort, for if we do that, we certainly run into the other; and ſo out of a ſhew to avoid Falſhood and Wrong, it is ſo managed by the cunning deluſion of Satan, that we do hereby fall into it. The World and all the things we have to do with here are made up of Intermixture and Contraries, where is Right and Wrong, Good and Evil, Truth and Falſhood, Apparent and Real: So that if we have not the one, we muſt have the other. If we have not the better we ſhall meet with the worſe. And therefore if we would indeed have the better we muſt know and chooſe it accordingly; but not deſpiſe and ſet at naught the more excellent things; for this is ſubmitting unto the worſe. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording hereunto the Wiſdom of God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, If thou ſhalt learn to put a <hi>difference between the Holy and Prophane,</hi> the <hi>Clean</hi> and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean,</hi> then <hi>ſhall ye be meet to come into mine Houſe.</hi> Such ſhall be meet to partake of the Inheritance with the Saints in Light, who can thus ſeek out and diſcern things in this place of Darkneſs. They ſhall be fit for Heaven who can and alſo do eſcape the Corruption that is in the World through Luſt, and thus order their Converſation
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:102492:136"/> aright here on Earth. <hi>The Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is like unto a Net that was caſt into the Sea, and gathered of every kind, which when it was full they drew to ſhoar and ſat down, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the good into Veſſels, but caſt the bad away,</hi> Matt. 13. 47, 48. And ſo whatever thoughts ariſe or are ſuggeſted to our mind, we are to entertain and nouriſh the Good, but to extinguiſh, caſt forth and not admit the Evil. In like manner it ſhould be of the words we hear or read; we are to gather and receive the good words into our Hearts, but to caſt the bad away. The Wheat is to be gathered and laid up in the Treaſure of our Heart, but the Chaff is to be blown away. Knowledge and Truth are to be ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and received; but Imagination and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood are to be thrown out. They are both mixed together; for as by Learning and by right Conſequences we come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, ſo a falſe and deceitful kind of Reaſoning will preſent it ſelf, and fallacious and miſtaken Conſequences will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe through the Sephiſtry of Satan and his Inſtruments, which we are likewiſe to diſcern before we pronounce Judgment, and try be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we Believe. Now every Man hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the right and true Promiſes or others which are not: And becauſe all People pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto and would have the firſt through Pride and Self-conceit, they miſtake which they have already for them, and ſo they will have no more nor better. <hi>The fear of the</hi>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:102492:137"/> 
                  <hi>Lord is the beginning of Knowledge, but Fools de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Wiſdom and Instruction,</hi> Prov. 1. 7. VVhen our Heart and Underſtanding is firſt lifted up towards God, and then looks down and ſees things as he ſees them; which muſt be in their very Nature; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he knows them who made and Eſtabliſh'd them. VVhen the Apprehenſive Faculty is enlightned from above and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with that which cometh down from the Father of Lights, we do firſt know and conſider of the Great God over all, and then how all other things were Created by him, but now they are under him to Govern and Rule according to his good Pleaſure, both the things in Heaven, the things in the Earth, and the things under the Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some have not the knowledge of God; I ſpeak this to your Shame,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 34. Neither have they the underſtanding of his Law, this is to their worſe deſerving. And whatever they pretend unto others or ſeem to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to know, it is ſeparated from them both. That is, they diſcern ſomewhat of the Creatures without the Creator. And becauſe they underſtand not his Law, neither do they perceive that Obligation they are under, and the true connexion of things one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So they are deſtitute of the true and uſeful Knowledge, and in the Language of the Holy Ghoſt, they are direct Fools <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ye Brutiſh among the People and ye Fools, when will ye be wiſe?</hi> Pſal. 94. 8. VVhich it
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:102492:137"/> is impoſſible they ſhould be, as long as they deſpiſe and reject the means of Being ſo. VVhat is real VViſdom and Inſtruction, may ſeem to them as Folly and Impertinency; when that indeed is ſo with which they pleaſe and content themſelves. So that VVord doth pronounce which is to Judge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of every Man's State and Condition, and according to which he is to receive.</p>
               <p>We are but Creatures upon Trial, and in that ſame word it is ſet down how God will be pleaſed to deal and add further with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of us. So that tho our different Thoughts and Apprehenſions do not ſignifie much as to one another, yet we muſt give Account to that God with whom we have to do, who is Judge of all Men and of all Things; and he hath expreſly foretold us that we ſhall receive according to the Good or Evil we have done. And tho in this wicked corrupt World they call <hi>Evil Good and Good Evil,</hi> Iſa. 5. 20. Becauſe they have the Multitude and Faſhion to bear them along with it, yet <hi>God is Judge himſelf,</hi> Pſal. 50. 6. <hi>Who will ſweep away the Refuge of Lies,</hi> Iſa. 28. 17. and adjuſt all things according to Righteouſneſs and Truth. If Men do at preſent contemn and refuſe what he doth command and eſteem of; and again they do honour and ſeek after what he hath forbidden and is an Abomination in his Sight. But God's Thoughts are not as our Thoughts, and his ways are not as our ways. He is not beholding to his Creatures.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:102492:138"/> He is great and highly Exalted; And what are a parcel of Worms of the Earth unto him? But yet themſelves ſhall know and feel what they get by this their oppoſition and contrariety to their Maker. If there was not Stubbornneſs and Rebellion in their hearts they might underſtand. For as the Eye doth diſcern Light from Darkneſs, and the Taſte doth perceive Sweet from Bitter: So likewiſe in this diverſity of things the Soul of Man can diſcern between Good and Evil, Truth and Falſhood, Wiſdom and Folly. <hi>Every Scribe that is inſtructed into the Kingdom of God, is like an Houſholder who brings out of his Treaſure things New and Old.</hi> Both ſorts are wholſome and good, which were firſt received in and he produces forth upon occaſion. <hi>Therefore ſhall ye lay up theſe my words in your Heart and your Soul,</hi> Deut. 11. 18. He means the words of the Spirit of God and of Truth. The greater number whereof the Mind is furniſhed withal, ſo much the better; <hi>That as the deſire of the Righteous is only good,</hi> Prov. 11. 13. Let him ſincerely and diligently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour that all the thoughts of his Heart may be good, true and ſignificative at all times, thereby ſhutting out Evil, Falſhood and Vanity. <hi>A good Man out of the good trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Heart bringeth forth good things,</hi> Matt. 12. 35. which may ſpring up into ſuitable Words and Actions. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy Truth, thy Word is Truth,</hi> John 17. 17. And People may diſcern what is rightly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:102492:138"/> and alledged, what is neceſſarily infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from this Word of Truth, for that alſo is true and will be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>And tho many falſe <hi>Chriſts</hi> and falſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> and <hi>Deceivers,</hi> have and are gone out into the World, as this ſame Word of Truth hath foretold, and it hath been verified by the experience of every Age, yet they delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more by their Signs and Wonders, by their forged Miracles and lying Legends (as thereby hath increaſed the <hi>Roman Church</hi>) more than by their Doctrin. For that of our Saviour is Remarkable, <hi>If it were poſſible they ſhall deceive the very Elect,</hi> Matt. 24. 24. But it is not poſſible to deceive them, for we have a ſtanding Word which is as a Rule or Touch-ſtone, to try the Doctrins whether they be of Men or no; and by ſetting our Conſciences in the ſight of God, and by the Spirit he hath given us we can ſearch out and know the hidden things of Diſhoneſty, and the practice of thoſe who handle the Word of God Deceitfully. But when the Truth is manifeſted, it will appear ſo to us. For great heed is to be taken leſt under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of avoiding Deceivers we do refuſe and turn away from him that ſpeaketh from Heaven, and ſo we ſhall not eſcape, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25. But be in danger to be excluded from thence. For this ſlanderous Report and falſe Imputation of a Deceiver was faſtned on our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Matt. 27. 63. and his choſen Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 7. and his Apoſtles,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102492:139"/> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 8. and upon almoſt all faithful Preachers and Writers ever ſince. Such is the Subtlety of Satan and his Inſtruments, by which he deceiveth the Nations, That he will firſt throw out that Reproach and Calumny falſly on others, to ward off divert and turn aſide that Imputation which truly falleth back upon himſelf. VVho are Deceivers indeed, they will call thoſe ſo who teach the way of God in Truth. For theſe laſt being obliged in the courſe of their Miniſtry to lay open every thing that helps forward the Salvation of Mankind and to hinder their Deſtruction as much as poſſible, they muſt alſo herein be like their great Maſter, as to give a caution to People to take heed what they hear, and to beware of thoſe who are Men-pleaſers more than the Servants of Chriſt. Nay, we muſt admoniſh of every thing which diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours God and brings danger unto Men, as unfaithful Teachers do both. But theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain through Pride and unwillingneſs to be Reformed, <hi>ſeeing they hate Inſtruction,</hi> Pſal. 50. 17. will endeavour to ſtop the way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the true handlers of the VVord of God; for the former ſort being ſecretly conſcious of what may be proved and manifeſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, they will try to be before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand and falſly accuſe or ſurmiſe ſuch to be guilty of that, which is truly their own Sin and Fault. This is one cauſe of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach which hath fallen on God's holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and People ſince the VVorld began.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102492:139"/> As alſo it ſhews the perverſeneſs and Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Mankind that they will as it were, <hi>Reply againſt God,</hi> Rom. 9. 20. In the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin it is Anſwereſt again and diſputeſt with God, which is to reſiſt his will, and it is a token of an unmannerly, proud and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Servant. VVhen they break his Laws and God tells them thereof by his VVord and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which he ſends forth through ſome of their Fellow Creatures, yet they are angry thereat and will retort upon them. Again, they have a mind to continue and go on ſtill in Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: But this telling them is a kind of ſtop and interruption which they do not like, and ſo they had rather remain Diſobedient, and have this for an excuſe that they did not know it. They would willingly be forgiven by God, yet what they do in this manner is a further Sin and Provocation. But God will ſearch it out (though we cannot ſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and exactly diſcover it) for he knoweth the very Secrets of the Heart. <hi>Who is wiſe and he ſhall underſtand theſe things, Prudent and he ſhall know them; for the ways of the Lord are right, and the Juſt ſhall walk in them, but the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors ſhall fall therein,</hi> Hoſ. 14. 19. The VViſe and Prudent know the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>vain words,</hi> Exod. 5. 9. (thoſe there were not ſo tho a Proud, Ignorant and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did call them ſo) and the words of Truth and Duty; the VViſe and Prudent know the difference between what words pertain to real Inſtruction, and what words are of empty Speculation; what ſerve
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102492:140"/> unto Godlineſs, or tend unto vain Jangling; what is good unto the uſe of Edifying, or miniſters only unto Idleneſs and Vanity.</p>
               <p>But Sinners do contrariwiſe in all theſe. They chuſe and are employed in the worſe, inſtead of the better. And though they make their boaſt not to regard nor live by Words, yet they are acted by Thoughts; which Thoughts are made up of Evil and Vanity, Falſhood and Folly. And even all their Thoughts might be uttered and written in Words as themſelves know what they think, and by what they are guided, which they could ſpeak forth or ſet down, and then they become words. But if theſe did appear in like manner, how ridiculous and fooliſh and vain would they be? <hi>Deſtroy thou them, O God. let them fall by their own Counſels: Caſt them out in the multitude of their Tranſgreſſions, for they have rebelled againſt thee,</hi> Pſal. 5. 10. Which is accordingly fulfilled, for they go on in their own Counſels till they fall and are Deſtroyed, and they are intangled in the multitude of their Tranſgreſſions till they actually drop into Puniſhment and Miſery. The Holy Ghoſt calleth them a <hi>Rebellious People, which walketh in a way that is not good after their own Thoughts,</hi> Iſa. 65. 2.</p>
               <p>This is the Queſtion and Controverſie which the Lord hath with the Inhabitants of the Earth, whether they ſhall do according to his revealed Will and Commandment, or go after their own Thoughts. Indeed they are for the laſt becauſe it hath a ſhew of Pride,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102492:140"/> Humour and Conveniency; but this is their Reward and utmoſt they will have, for it will never attain to any real and laſting Good. And when a ſingle VVorm of the Earth ſhall prefer and follow his own will againſt that of the great Lord of the VVorld, it doth <hi>Provoke the Lord to Anger conninually,</hi> Iſa. 65. 3. As if their own Thoughts were better than God's Thoughts. They will ſtrive for Maſterdom and have their own Imaginations and Sayings above the VVill and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. This is plain <hi>Walking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to him, to which is threatned that he will <hi>bring ſeven times more Plagues upon them according to thiir Sins,</hi> Lev. 26. 21. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it is further added, <hi>Then I will walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary alſo unto you in Fury, and I even I, will chaſtiſe you ſeven times for your Sins,</hi> Verſe 28. <hi>If ye walk contrary,</hi> &amp;c. Their manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is expreſſed in the Preſent Tenſe, For now is the time of their Trial, but how God will deal with them is Future, for it ſhall be rendred accordingly. As alſo to prove in the mean while whether they will be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their Sin and Iniquity, and do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Law.</p>
               <p>Indeed all People do one or the other. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they live according to what is contained or directed in the word God, or according to what is thought and Imagined in the Hearts of Men. VVhich (as aforeſaid) might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed forth in words, ſo it is near the ſame thing. Or the Men are led by the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Suggeſtions of Satan, which alſo as
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:102492:141"/> they appear to the Mind in an intelligible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo they might be ſpoken forth. But none will plead outwardly for them; and therefore the Queſtion in ſhort turns upon this Point, VVhether we ſhall go according to Divine or Human VVords; for all People High and Low, Rich and Poor, are guided con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually by one or the other. VVhich of the twain is our bounden Duty, and which is the beſt and alſo which is the wiſeſt way for the attainment of Good and Happineſs that hath been largely before demonſtrated. There is <hi>Line upin Line, Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept, Precept upon Precept.</hi> Here a little and there a little, Iſa. 21. 10. throughout the whole Book of God. And yet more in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and number of words hath been delivered from the Tongue and Pen of his Saints of the ſeveral Generations ſince the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. So much hath been ſaid and done to make this appear unto the ungodly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient in order to reſtrain them from the Error of their ways, that if it was all written, (as indeed a great deal thereof is) I ſuppoſe that a Man's whole Life would not ſuffice to Read it. Nay, they ſeem to reject it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that ſeeming multitude of words touching this Matter, yet themſelves go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own Thoughts, though theſe are more than what do occurs to their Mind concerning Goodneſs and Duty. They are acted and led by the multitude of their own Thoughts, and they do not refuſe to go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them for all their vaſt number.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102492:141"/> 
                  <hi>Like Brute Beasts made to be taken and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> They follow the Herd not knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they go, for they perceive not when they are preſſing on to be Killed and Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And there are alſo to be found too many called Reaſonable Creatures, who remain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as Ignorant, when they are in the way to Death and Hell. The way of Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Sin leads directly to it; and yet too many continue therein without fear. They have the Multitude and Faſhion on their ſide, and they are for doing what the moſt do, eſpecially thoſe of the Richer ſort: They are for going <hi>according to the courſe of the World,</hi> though they <hi>ſhould be condemned with the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 32. And they think it good to ſwim with the Stream, not knowing that it tends to the bottomleſs Pit.</p>
               <p>Satan, who deceiveth the whole World, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 9. hath found out this device to blind them in his and their <hi>own Deceivings</hi> (ſo called 2 Pet. 2. 13.) For they imagine that they do not Err, becauſe they have ſo many of their ſide; however they ſhall fare as well as the moſt, and they ſhall be in the ſame condition with others according to whom they do in this preſent World. To do as others do is one Thought by which the Men of this World act; and it is here expreſſed forth in words: So it is the ſame principle of Action which they hold unto, tho it be not ſpoken out or written. But to do barely as others do without regard had to Good or Evil, Duty or Sin, to what is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or what is Forbidden, is Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:102492:142"/> and Folly now which ends in Puniſhment and Miſery hereafter. Alas! ſuch do not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there is a great God over all, who now looketh from Heaven upon all the Inhabitants of the Earth, and conſidereth all their Works; who hath given a Law for them to live by, and he is to judge and render to every Man according to his Deeds.</p>
               <p>If People did conſider throughly, and would do acccording <hi>to the Moſt,</hi> they ſhould do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's Will, for himſelf is more than all the Generations of Mankind, and ſo more than all that are now living. He is more than ten thouſand times ten thouſand kind of Creatures, which are any where in the World, above the Firmament, or in the vaſt and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Air, in the habitable parts of the Earth, or any where underneath and without the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible World; for all things were created by him, whether Viſible or Inviſible, <hi>Thrones</hi> or <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers. Thy Will be done, in Earth as it is in Heaven,</hi> Matt. 6. 10. So it is more Univerſally as Heaven is greater than Earth, which is but a part and next to nothing. The <hi>Innumerable Company of Angels,</hi> Heb. 12. 22. Thoſe many ſorts of Creatures, whether Animate or Inanimate; Thoſe <hi>ten thouſand of his Saints, whereof</hi> Enoch <hi>propheſieth,</hi> Jude 14. <hi>The hundred and fourty four thouſand of all the Tribes of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and that great Multitude, which no Man could number of all Nations and Kindreds, and People and Tongues,</hi> Rev. 7. 4, 9. All theſe obey and fulfil the Word of God, and they do his Pleaſure. And thoſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102492:142"/> are many more than all thoſe Rebels now living upon the Earth, or thoſe Generations of ſinful Men ſince the World began, <hi>Whom the Lord hath carried away as with a Flood,</hi> Pſal. 90. 5. to be delivered over to the Lake of filth and ſtink, or like the <hi>Graſs which in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is cut down and withereth,</hi> Verſe 6. and is to be burnt with <hi>unquenchable Fire.</hi> And ſo it will be of all thoſe which are yet to ſucceed, until there be an End made of <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> and the <hi>Sinners be conſumed out of the Earth, and the Wicked be no more,</hi> Pſal. 104. 35.</p>
               <p>A little after the Creation <hi>All Fleſh had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted its way upon the Earth,</hi> Gen. 6. 12. which cauſed the Flood, whereby the World that then was, being over-flowed with Water pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. <hi>But the Heavens and the Earth which are now, by the ſame Word are kept in ſtore, reſerved unto Fire againſt the Day of Judgment, and Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly Men,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 6, 7. As certainly as the Flood came upon thoſe in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo certainly ſhall the whole World be conſumed by Fire. The Puniſhment and Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God are executed by <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> which do drown and conſume many as well as few. And Death that conſigns them over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, hath reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> ever ſince. <hi>Hell hath enlarged her ſelf and opened her mouth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure; and their Glory, and their Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and their Pomp, and he that rejoyceth ſhall deſcend into it,</hi> Iſa. 5. 14. which hath been and continues unto this day to be fulfilled. So it is a vain Shelter and fooliſh Safety, to think to eſcape with the Many, for God can and doth
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:102492:143"/> as eaſily deal with them as with few. We ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly know, that within ſeventy or eighty Years, within the compaſs of the Age of a Man, he doth quite empty the Earth of all its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and cauſeth others to ſpring up in their ſtead; whom again he takes away in his own order. And though now they aſſemble themſelves in Companies to commit Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and gather by Troops to do Miſchief; Yet they drop away one by one into the Bars of the Pit, and he ſcatters them that they fall ſeverally, until they all die away and come to nothing. He doth now give his expreſs Command by his Servant <hi>Moſes, Thou ſhalt not follow a Multitude to do Evil,</hi> Exod. 23. 2. and forewarns us by the Son of his Love, whom he ſent to Redeem and Preſerve us from it: <hi>Wide is the Gate, and Broad is the Way, which leadeth unto Deſtruction, and many there be which go in thereat,</hi> Matt. 7. 13. So that who is for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt the Multitude, He will be amongſt them alſo, and ſo he will miſs of that narrow way which leadeth unto Life. Nor will he be one of thoſe few who find it.</p>
               <p>Indeed there is an Inclination in Man to do as the reſt of his Brethren do, but then he hath ſome ſeeming Reaſon for it, or he is void of Underſtanding as to have no ſet and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Principle of Action; and then he can juſt conceive what others do, and order him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to do according. Example is a ſenſible and viſible thing, and thereupon it hath ſuch a ſtrong Prevalency over moſt; and it is yet ſtronger over thoſe who know not what it is
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:102492:143"/> to live by Faith, nor act by hope of unſeen things. But they are moſt led on thereby, who leaſt think within themſelves. A Multitude is made up of ſeveral diſtinct Perſons, which conſpire in one thing or near the ſame. But it was received of one or few before it is made known unto and embraced by many, and then the like Diſadvantage lay againſt it, as now they conceive on the other ſide. But it is ſaid now, it hath the more general Acceptation. Why, the moſt do ſwallow it without Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And who admit thereof, muſt have ſome Rule. Then which God hath given none other unto Men beſides his Word, which is to try Good and Evil, Duty and Tranſgreſſion, as alſo what may be diſcerned from the Truth and Reality of things. There is no other way under Heaven, whereby we may be Happy, but this only.</p>
               <p>Now every one deſires to be Happy, that is, To enjoy what Good he can, and to avoid Evil. Even thoſe have that Wiſh and Intention who <hi>turn aſide every one to his own Way.</hi> Who live as their Neighbours and Acquaintance, and as the reſt of the World do; why this hath a ſhew of Peace and Good Will, and they do hereby avoid the odious thing of Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the Irkſomneſs of Reproach. But they ſhould do well to conſider in the firſt place, of <hi>Glory to God in the Higheſt.</hi> How is that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to their kind of <hi>Peace on Earth,</hi> and <hi>Good Will towards Men.</hi> Their Hearts ſhould be lifted up with Angels and the Heavenly Hoſt towards him, who ſitteth above and <hi>remaineth</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:102492:144"/> 
                  <hi>King for ever,</hi> And how is he honoured by ſuch a kind of Life as the Inhabitants of the Earth lead, which is made up of Forgetfulneſs of their Maker, Sin and Sloth. How are his Statutes kept and his Laws obſerved? Are <hi>Peace and Truth met together</hi> as in the days of <hi>Hezekiah?</hi> ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39. 8. Or is it like the Hills of the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the Aſſemblies of the Ungodly and Wicked, an Agreement together to preſerve their old accuſtomed Ignorance, Corruption and Error? And then thoſe who would teach Knowledge and guide into Truth, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Enemies to Civil Society, and Troublers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Church of God. And what is the commonly called Good Will, but to <hi>let every one do what is right in his own Eyes.</hi> Not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with their Sins and Tranſgreſſions, To avoid <hi>Sound Doctrine, Reproof, Correction, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> in <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> for all this hath a ſhew of Diſturbance. It is ſaid to ſpoil Family-Peace and good Neighbourhood. Even in this <hi>Antichriſtian Age</hi> wherein things are turned upſide down, ſuch <hi>are thought not to ſeek the Welfare of this People but the Hurt,</hi> Jer. 38. 4. who are <hi>not willing that any ſhould Periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance;</hi> who Study, Pray and Teach, and do uſe all the outward means poſſible to help forward the <hi>common Salvation.</hi> But this is our Comfort and Encouragement, that the Spirit of God witneſſeth the ſame (which we alſo find and wiſh in our Hearts) That they do indeed <hi>bring Good Tidings</hi> and <hi>publiſh Peace, and alſo that they have Good Will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men,</hi> notwithſtanding they are eſteemed
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:102492:144"/> and reproached contrariwiſe by the World. Even the Saviour thereof (unto whom this and all Scripture hath more eſpecial Relation) witneſſed what himſelf found; The <hi>World hateth me, becauſe I teſtifie of it that the Works thereof are Evil,</hi> John 7. 7. But this is a double Iniquity; firſt to do Evil, and then what is yet worſe, To hate him, <hi>even Jeſus, whom God ſent to bleſs them, in turning away every one of them from his Iniquities,</hi> Acts 3. 26. In order to which it is firſt neceſſary to tell and ſhew them thereof. When God would have Men turn from their evil doings, they kill and evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thoſe whom he ſends on his Meſſage. <hi>They hate him that rebuketh in the Gate, and they abhor him that ſpeaketh uprightly,</hi> Amos 5. 10. They cannot endure to be interrupted in their courſe.</p>
               <p>But is their courſe Good or Evil, right or wrong? If the VVorld did that which is Good and Righteous, they need not be afraid of the Miniſters of God; for then they would meet with Praiſe and Encouragement from them, inſtead of what they now look upon as Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Diſturbance. Then indeed all three would meet together, <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt and on Earth Peace, Good Will towards Men,</hi> Luke 2. 13. <hi>When the People are gathered together and the Kingdoms to ſerve the Lord;</hi> when they walk and agree in his Fear and Obedience, then they have R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt and Comfort. Then we may do as others do as long as they keep unto the ſame Rule; and ſo long we have Peace and rejoycing one with another. But then we do
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:102492:145"/> after this or that manner, not becauſe others do the like, but we ſee it thus written, and we are ſo directed.</p>
               <p>This is one conſiderable difference between the Good and Evil, Righteous and VVicked, that the firſt have a ſet Rule of Action, God and his VVord; whereas the Evil and VVick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have not ſo much regard to that, but they are led on by the Example of others and by their own Imaginations. The Example is the Multitude of the Richer ſort, who though feweſt in Number, yet have Influence on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for theſe crave after VVorldly Goods and have their <hi>Their Perſons in Admiration,</hi> the which they beſtow and convey down to have others that are thus beholding unto and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on them. So that here it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, that for Profit and Intereſt they act after this manner.</p>
               <p>But even this Argument (if ſtretched out throughly) would bring them into the right way. <hi>What is a Man profited if he ſhould gain the whole World and loſe his own Soul?</hi> Matt. 16. 20. Is not Happineſs and Salvation more than preſent Gain and Advantage? And what if that ſhould be loſt by omiſſion of Duty and commiſſion of Sin? They miſemploy that Diligence and precious Time, which might be ſpent on a more excellent thing and would tend to better account. <hi>For every Man ſhall bear his own Burthen,</hi> Gal. 6. 5. And likewiſe every one ſhall receive the reward of his own Labour. And therefore what others do, what is that to thee? Mind thy ſelf and thine own
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:102492:145"/> things. Thou wouldſt have good to thy ſelf and avoid Miſery, why then go in the way, and uſe the Means accordingly. Anothers Happineſs extends not to thee; for it rather raiſes Envy and a greater Reſentment. So that the Miſery of others is but a poor Reiief and Comfort to thine own. Still as thou art divided from others, ſo thou muſt labour to ſecure and embetter thine own Condition ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted and ſeparated from that of Others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The whole World lieth in Wickedneſs,</hi> 1 John 5. 19. Which as ſure as God's Word is true, will involve them into Condemnation and Miſery. Even thoſe who now are for living according to the vain Manners and Cuſtoms of the VVorld, would not willingly have ſuch an End. But it is the particular Sins of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons which make up the general cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Many; and they are ſubject to that Puniſhment which is now denounced from Heaven, and will be inflicted accordingly at the time ſpoken of. <hi>Can thine Heart endure, or can thine Hands be ſtrong in the days that I ſhall deal with thee? I the Lord have ſpoken it, and will do it,</hi> Ezek. 22. 14. <hi>When thou crieſt, let thy Companies deliver thee: But the wind ſhall carry them all away,</hi> Iſa. 57. 13. They are under the ſame ſmart and pain themſelves and cannot caſe thee, but rather increaſe your Howlings and cauſe a deeper ſenſe of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery which ye are all plunged into. It will not be a ſufficient exchange for the loſs of Eternal Happineſs, to be a little puffed up with following the humours and ways of the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:102492:146"/> Multitude; for the utmoſt advantage and conveniency thereof, at preſent, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe for the Danger of what is to come. The reputation of Good Nature, of being So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable and Compliant, All the Eaſe, gain and Profit thereof, cannot countervail ſo great a Loſs and Pain. Much leſs will not thoſe things whereof there is no benefit at all but only to gratifie a ſudden tranſient Humour, and barely to conform unto the Example and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of others.</p>
               <p>Of which nature are thoſe ſeveral things of Ungodlineſs, and that faſhioning and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeveral parts of the Worſhip of God. The chief Reaſon why ſo many continue Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and do not <hi>tread God's Courts,</hi> or they do it only on the Lord's day, and not every day, as was the manner of the firſt Chriſtians to <hi>Continue daily in he Temple,</hi> Acts 2. 46. Is becauſe they ſee that moſt do the like of the ſame Age and Circumſtances with themſelves. And they are for not varying from the becauſe, they would not be accounted odd and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, nor have their Reputation leſſened. Now to examine this and other things of like Nature by that often mentioned Rule, In e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing one takes in hand or admits of, and ſo in all Debates and doubts of Mind it might be reduced to this, Whether the good or evil of a thing will be greater? Whether it is better to do, or to leave ſuch a thing undone. And that taking in the conſideration of the time to come as well as the preſent; for that will as certainly be preſent alſo. And then
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:102492:146"/> a Wiſe Man knoweth what he hath to do or not, to Chooſe or Refuſe. Now if in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe, that ſingle Thought only will do a Man as much good, and ſtand him in as much ſtead throughout a whole Eternity, as it is now ſuppoſed in the days of his Fleſh, then indeed it is vain to go into the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and it is no profit to walk Mournfully before the Lord of Hoſts and conſtantly to keep his Ordinances, according to the ſurmiſe of the <hi>Prophane Sinners</hi> in Mal. 3. But ſurely his Word and Promiſe, thoſe many immutable things in which it is impoſſible for God to Lie, for the Reward to thoſe who diligently ſeek and ſerve him, all theſe may be more ſurely truſted unto than what is only imagined, in the vain, falſe and wicked Minds of Men. This may be ſenſibly perceived as a manifeſt token and forerunner of a greater loſs, that their Ungodlineſs at this preſent time comes to nothing at all. It hath a regret at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times it is practiced, which is more bitter than the imagined tediouſneſs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Duty; and they do again falſly hope that it will be paſſed over in Forgetfulneſs or Excuſe. A <hi>Book of Remembrance is written,</hi> Mal. 3. 18. That it may be diſcerned between them who ſerve God and who ſerve him not. And ſo between thoſe wha do it more or leſs, with the ſeveral Circumſtances belonging thereunto.</p>
               <p>Though there is now <hi>the ſame Event to him that Sacrificeth or Sacrificeth</hi> not, yet the Judge of all the Earth ſhall do Right. <hi>Though a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:102492:147"/> 
                  <hi>doth Evil an hundred times and his days be prolonged, yet ſurely I know it ſhall be well with them which fear God, which fear before him,</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 12. In that day there is none but would be of the <hi>Lord's Jewels</hi> if they might, and they would be willingly ſpared by him as a Man ſpareth his own Son that Serveth him. But then they muſt endeavour to pleaſe and find acceptance with him in the mean while, for if there ſhould never ſo much be done in things pertaining to God, and he ſhould not like nor accept thereof, it profiteth nothing. As again, if he is well pleaſed with our Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Works, we have the utmoſt that we can deſire on this ſide of Heaven, for we have the earneſt and aſſured hope of his Favour and Reward,</p>
               <p>That we may not Serve him with Doubt and Ignorance, we are to take heed that. <hi>We do all things according to the Pattern in his Word.</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>admoniſhed of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle; for ſee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thou make all things according to the Pattern ſhewed to thee in the Mount,</hi> Heb. 8. 5. For this is according to his expreſs Command, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it is agreeable to the Duty of a Son or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to do according as it is Commanded and directed unto him, or they know aſſuredly ſuch the continual Employment which their Father or Maſter would have them to do. But when <hi>Men chooſe their own ways,</hi> Iſa. 66. 3. it is in God's Sight and Eſtimation, as <hi>Cutting off a Dogs Neck,</hi> or as <hi>Offering Swines Blood;</hi> which is an Abomination, and doth diſpleaſe him
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:102492:147"/> yet more. Or if they do a great multitude of meer Acts of outward Religion, yet when theſe Works come to be examined of what ſort they are, inſtead of a Commendation and Reward, it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of them, <hi>Who hath required this at your Hand to tread my Courts,</hi> Iſa. 1. 12. 'Tis not the <hi>Much ſpeaking of the Heathen,</hi> nor yet <hi>The Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of Jew or Papiſt,</hi> nor thoſe ſeveral kinds of Worſhip to the One God, or Many that are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the ſeveral Nations of the World, which makes God to hear or accept thereof. But known unto God are the Works of all Men, and it is left unto him how he will be pleaſed to deal with them accordingly. As Bodily Exerciſe profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo outward Services are little available; but the Heart is that which God looks unto, and with what Mind they are done. It muſt be with an intention to pleaſe him, and to pleaſe him only. Thereby ſhutting out all Cuſtom and <hi>Conformity to the World,</hi> Rom. 12. 2. Unleſs before they are agreed in a Right thing. In things pertaining to God no reſpect muſt be had unto Men; <hi>For God will not give his Glory unto another,</hi> nor any part of his Worſhip to Men of the ſame Likeneſs with our ſelves. And yet how common is it in the World, to do thus and thus in Religion, becauſe thoſe which have the Reputation of Great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wiſe Men, do the fame. Whereas, we do not underſtand nor conſider throughly that theſe have provoked God to Jealouſie and Diſpleaſure with their Inventions, and now he ſuffers them to err from the right way, For ſeeing they were not contented with that Rule which God had given them, but deſpiſed it for the ſeeming plainneſs
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:102492:148"/> and Simplicity thereof: And they would find out ſomething which ſhould ſeem outwardly more Wiſe and make a greater ſhew, than a true and Spiritual Worſhip doth. It pleaſed God to let a poor and mean People Serve him and be Saved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner; but the others are left ſtill to go on in their own ways, in which they miſtake and Periſh! God is the ſame ſtill; His Thoughts are not as our Thoughts, <hi>He hath choſen the fooliſh things of the World to confoudd the Wiſe; and God hath choſen the Weak things of the World to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the things which are Mighty; and Baſe things of the World and things which I are Deſpiſed hath God choſen, yea, and things which are not to bring to naught things that are: That no Fleſhk ſhould glory in his Preſence,</hi> 1 Cor. 27, 28, 29. See that whole Chapter. <hi>Caſt abroad the rage of thy wrath, and behold every one that is Proud and abaſe him,</hi> Job 40. 11. That he may cut off all occaſion of Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There is no obliging of God with any thing exabundant, or with doing more than is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; for we have all ſinned and come ſhort of that, nor yet ſhould we preſume to do beſides what is required, for he doth diſown and is diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with all that. Any thing that ſavours the leaſt of Pride, is an Abomination to God, and ſo what would make any pretence to Merit or deſerving all this is rejected by him.</p>
               <p>Man was at firſt the work of God's own Hands. Yet I had planted thee a noble Vine, wholly a right Seed. How then art thou turned into the Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Plant of a ſtrange Vine unto me, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 21. For ſince that every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was only Evil continually,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:102492:148"/> 
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. Man hath been ſo univerſally Corrupt throughout, that till he is Renewed again after the Image of him who Created him, which in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, he ſtands not only diſtinguiſhed from, but as it were in perfect contrariety unto God. Said our Saviour to one of his Diſciples, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan thou art an Offence unto me, for thou Savoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of Men,</hi> Matt. 16. 23. As if the things which did ſavour of Men were a Stink and evil Smell and a <hi>Smoak in his Noſe,</hi> Iſa. 65. 5. which he could not endure, and would have behind or a far off from him. Indeed the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Holineſs and Uprightneſs of God is in no wiſe reconcileable to Man's Sin and Corruption; and he doth the more abominate and loath it when he beholds it covered with the Mask and Viſour of Hypocriſie. Who is all-Wiſe and all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he doth pity and deſpiſe our Folly and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; but it is a further Aggravation, ſo that he cannot or rather will not endure therewith when Worms of the Earth would be wiſe beyond their Maker, or pretend to know otherwiſe than he knoweth and hath decreed or purpoſed; It doth provoke him juſtly to Anger, That when the Sun, Moon and Stars, and the whole Family in Heaven ſo much Greater and more Excellent Creatures than we, do obſerve the Law which he hath made. And ſeeing he hath given unto Men Laws, which are Holy, Righteous and Good; he hath ſhewed unto us ſtrait ways, yet ſtubborn and diſobedient Man will not keep and walk in them, but every one is for walking after <hi>the Imagination of his own evil Heart.</hi> And as they live and are joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:102492:149"/> in Civil Society, ſo this carries on the courſe of the World, and each Perſon doth make a part of and contribute unto the univerſal Sin and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Imagination,</hi> doth import no ſet Rule of Action, but it is a Wandring or Gueſs. Now it thinks it may be thus, but is afterward miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And this is ſo much the worſe as the End is more excellent which it aims at. Now that End is Good and Happineſs. Every Soul (as aforeſaid) is in purſuit thereof, and his ſeveral Actions are intended accordingly. There is <hi>One God over all, One rule of Action in his Word,</hi> One End of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Happineſs or Miſery; and all the deeds done in the Body, are as ſo many Steps to one or the other. This is actually ſo though too many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it not; nor conſider thereof in the time of Probation and Tryal. To walk all along in a vain and falſe Imagination, and be deceived at laſt when this is but once for all Eternity, when there is no poſſible Redreſs of this Errour, muſt very much enhanſe the Folly and Miſery of ſuch a Man. The firſt Errour and Evil is in having departed from God and caſting away his Fear, and exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf from his Obedience. For though it is ſo ſuffered in this Life to prove Mankind more perfectly, that it may be ſeen, It is poſſible for him to run out his days here without having due regard and reſpect to his Maker and Preſerver; yet it is known unto God and alſo Revealed unto us how he will be pleaſed to deal further with them. Even according as we order our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and as our doings are. That Word by which we are to Live, be Judged, and receive accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:102492:149"/> doth now forewarn and acquaint us that things will be otherwiſe or contrary to what they appear now. <hi>For that which is highly eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, is abomination in the ſight of God,</hi> Luke 16. 15. And ſo what is univerſally received and faſhionable among us, will be rejected and even loathed by him.</p>
               <p>He hath left another Rule to follow than the Multitude or the meer Example of others. An Holy Man of God doth ſpeak on this wiſe, <hi>Be ye followers of me, even as I alſo am of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 1. But no otherwiſe, for Chriſt <hi>had done no Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, neither was any deceit found in his Mouth.</hi> He was the Holy one of God, and in him was found no Sin. So that if we do the ſame which he did, we may be aſſured that it is not Sinful. Again, his Meat and Drink was to do the will of God, and he did always the things which pleaſed his Heavenly Father: So that if therein we follow his Steps as we have him for an Example, and do the like things that he did, we may hereby know that we do the will of God alſo, and what is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and acceptable in his Sight. But every Man beſides is a Liar; for they have all (both Saint and Sinner, none excepted) varied and gone aſide either in ſome ſingle tranſient Inſtances, or in many continued ones from the Word of Truth and from the right way. It is Written, <hi>And thou ſhalt not go aſide from any of the Words which I command thee this day to the right hand or to the left,</hi> Deut. 28. 14. That is neither to one Extream nor yet to the other. But where is the Man or Woman, who have not gone aſide from any of the words wich the Lord God hath Commanded in the Bible,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:102492:150"/> both as it comprehends all that is written in the Old and New Teſtament. Both Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, yea all Mankind of every Generation and Country are under Sin, and have come ſhort of what God requied in his Law. So that whoever doth follow any of theſe Examples in all things, even of the moſt Perfect and Upright among the meer Sons of Men, he will go aſide with them even unto the Tranſgreſſion: So that the word of God is to be our Rule, and not the Example of others.</p>
               <p>However prone and ſubject the People of the World are to follow the Examples of their Fellow Creatures and to do what others do of near the ſame Age, Condition and Circumſtances of Life; yet in theſe times of the Univerſal Reformation of the World, which is now drawing on in theſe latter days, we muſt labour and endeavour Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to beat off and diſſuade People from acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that dangerous and miſtaken Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of following the Multitude and being led by the Example of others. For beſides that to follow the Multitude, is a ſure token that ſuch are amongſt <hi>thoſe many which go in the Broad way which leads unto Dsſtruction; and they are not amongſt thoſe few in the Narrow way which leadeth unto Life,</hi> Matt. 7. 13, 14. This ſeems to lye as the greateſt Prejudice againſt the ways of God, That though all his Commandments are <hi>Juſt, Holy</hi> and <hi>Good;</hi> And it is meet and right for all People at all times to obſerve the ſame; Yet ſtill nevertheleſs very few People do obſerve them. When the Scripture ſpeaks of thoſe glorious times <hi>Thy People alſo ſhall be all Righteous,</hi> Iſa. 60. 21. And how that <hi>the Sinners will be conſumed out of the Earth, and the wicked will be no more,</hi> Pſal. 104. 35.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:102492:150"/> For in what Prayer the Spirit of Truth doth Dict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, is included a Promiſe that ſo it ſhall be. As we read theſe and alike Places, what in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's Phraſe, is a <hi>very lovely Song,</hi> Ezek. 33. 32. And <hi>Peter</hi> reciteth from the faying of others, As if the <hi>Scriptures were a cunningly deviſed Fable.</hi> So in our way of ſpeaking, thoſe Scriptures ſeem to be as a pleaſant Romance, which contain things that were to be indeed wiſhed and deſired; but at firſt ſight they do not ſeem to be grounded on Truth; for the thing neither as yet is ſo, and there is no ſuch great outward likelyhood and probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that it will ever be ſo. What, <hi>thy People ſhall be all Righteous,</hi> when now not more than One in an Hundred are ſtrictly and univerſally ſo. And for the <hi>Sinners to be conſumed out of the Earth, and for the Wicked to be no more,</hi> How can this be, when all places are now full of them? But yet as the <hi>Waters of Noah</hi> did once cover the Earth, and ſo a common Flood doth now cover ſeveral parts thereof and the lower Grounds, which goes off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: So that Deluge of Sin and Ungodlineſs, which hath ſo long for many Years and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions overſpread the face of all Nations, will at length quite go off and never return again.</p>
               <p>An Inlet and preparatory to this glorious day of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs throughout the Earth will be when People ſhall once begin to leave off living by Examples, but they ſhall live according to the <hi>Word of God</hi> and the <hi>Dictates of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho <hi>Satan</hi>'s <hi>Kingdom</hi> hath ſtood a long time yet it hath been all along upheld as it were by Threads, or as the <hi>Spider</hi>'s <hi>Web,</hi> or as <hi>Brittle Glaſs.</hi> I mean, that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:102492:151"/> it hath been erected upon ſo ſlender a Foundation, and holden up by ſuch weak Props, that if any thing had touched and beat vehemently upon it, it would have fallen in that part thereof; for as ſoon as it had been touched or grappled with, it would have preſently broken and ſnapped aſunder: And when when it was made up again, it was as Thread or Tow tied together, or like a Spider's Web made over again, or as the broken pieces of Glaſs ſet together again which was ſomewhat weaker than the former. To theſe and ſuch-like Similitudes all thoſe Thoughts and Imaginations in Men and Women may be compared; by which the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and unſeen Spirit did work in the Children of Diſobedience, for it was all either Evil or Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood. And whenſoever Grace and Truth had alſo an entrance into their Minds, and did once begin to cloſe and grapple therewith, it did put it all to flight and overcame the Temptations and Suggeſtions of the Evil one, which he would bring on again after the aforeſaid manner.</p>
               <p>As heretofore obſerved, almoſt all Satan's Temptation is comprized in that which he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to our Grandmother <hi>Eve, And when the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaw that the Tree was good for Food, and that it was pleaſant to the Eyes, and a Tree to be deſired to make one Wiſe, ſhe took of the Fruit thereof and did Eat,</hi> Gen. 3. 6. So that <hi>Goodneſs, Pleaſure, Deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſs,</hi> (which laſt may be alſo expreſſed by conveniency or Expediency, are the three Baits, which the Serpent <hi>who is more Subtle than any Beaſt of the Field,</hi> doth make uſe of to fiſh for and catch the Souls of Men and VVomen; and where he alſo tempteth them to any Sin or act of Diſobedience;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:102492:151"/> which doth not ſeem either <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Pleaſant,</hi> or <hi>Deſirable;</hi> But it is either Humour or Froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or VVillfulneſs, or they know not what reaſon they have for it, but they do it for all; There com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is Company and Example of others, like natural brute Beaſts, Oxen or Sheep, which go on with the Drove and as they ſee others before them, not knowing where or wherefore. To do as others do, ſeems convenient or expedient, which comes under one of thoſe three Heads of <hi>Goodneſs, Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Deſireableneſs;</hi> for it is thought Safe, and alſo it prevents that Hatred and Ill-will which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly annexed to Singularity. VVho do not in all their Actions ſeek to pleaſe God, yet commonly theſe ſame Perſons endeavour to pleaſe other Men, or their own ſelves, that is, Their own Luſt and VVill, or the ſinful Deſires of the Fleſh. By which is ſhewn forth that Principle ingrafted in them by the God who formed them of Pleaſing ſome one, which ſhould be terminated and ariſe up to their Maker and Creator only; but with them it is turn'd aſide to their Fellow-Creatures, or to themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſting down Imaginations</hi> (in the Margent it is Reaſonings) <hi>and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God, and bringing into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity every thought to the Obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 5. To expreſs ſorth theſe ſeveral Imaginations and every Thought, would ſwell this Treatiſe to a prodigious bulk. And indeed many of the Thoughts of Men are ſo vain and trivial, that they are not worthy to be ſpoken out, or to be ſet down in Ink and Paper. But for thoſe Imaginations which carry a ſhew of Reaſoning with them, if the Reader would narrowly and attentively obſerve, how each of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:102492:152"/> them is anſwered and <hi>caſt down,</hi> by the like words of Truth as that is effected, any other new Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as it ſhall ariſe, may in the ſame or like manner be anſwered and <hi>caſt down</hi> alſo. The Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor of <hi>caſting down</hi> is (I ſuppoſe) in alluſion to Wreſtling at the Olympick Games, which were in uſe among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and there ſometimes a Tall Boaſting Fellow would come into the Ring, whom another leſs Man who had more Skill (though not equal in outward Appearance) would oftentimes gives the Foil unto and <hi>caſt him down.</hi> And ſo for <hi>bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Chriſt.</hi> This is alſo a <hi>Similitude</hi> (in which the Holy Ghoſt delights, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 10.) taken from Warriors, where both the Adverſe Parties contend and fight together; and they try with all their Strength and Skill who can kill or take one another Captive. There is a very near reſemblance between things Viſible and Inviſible; for ſo it is likewiſe (as we may ſee with the <hi>Eyes of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding being enlightned</hi>) between the Thoughts of Good and Truth, and the Suggeſtions of Satan and the Dictates of Evil and Falſhood. All theſe are contrary one to the other, and they do fight and contend together in the Soul of Man. They ſtrive there for Maſtery, which ſhall prevail, which the Man ſhall be lead and governed by. And according as this is, ſo is the Diſcrimination to be made of <hi>Godly</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly, Righteous</hi> and <hi>Wicked,</hi> they <hi>that ſerve</hi> God, and they <hi>that ſerve</hi> him <hi>not;</hi> for the Godly and Righteous and the Servants of God, are ever, or for the moſt part led and governed by the Words of his Grace and Truth. And when there is a War and Conteſt in their Souls, whether
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:102492:152"/> they ſhall overcome, or the Temptation of the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life; Their Faith in the unſeen God, and their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Fear of him, and the ſenſe of his Law written in their Hearts, do conſtantly, or at leaſt moſt commonly overcome all the other Aſſaults of the Evil one. Whereas the Ungodly, and the Wicked and Rebels, have indeed a faint remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and a ſmall ſenſe of that Obedience they owe unto God and his Law. But in all theſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, or for the moſt part, they ſhew themſelves to be Servants of Sin and Evil; By conſenting unto and doing the ſeveral Acts thereof, as often as they were proved and tried. <hi>They are a Rebellious People, which walketh in a way that was not Good, after their own Thoughts,</hi> Iſa. 65. 2. and not according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of God's Word and the Dictates of his Spirit. Unto which they did owe an Allegiance as ſoon as they were born, and an Obedience as ſoon as ever they came to the Knowledge of Good and Evil. But caſting off and giving no heed to that, they are here truly and properly termed <hi>Rebellious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou haſt delivered me from the ſtrivings of the People.</hi> Which <hi>ſtrivings of the People</hi> are thoſe Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Doubts, and givings back in the Heart of Man, before he yields up himſelf unto the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of God and of his Chriſt. Theſe <hi>Strivings</hi> would dethrone God and Chriſt out of the Soul; And ſo they have ſtrove and endeavoured for many Generations ſucceſſively in the Hearts of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral People thereof. To which the anſwer of the Lord is ever ſince the days of <hi>Noah</hi> unto this time, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man, for that he</hi>

In which I will by no means ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it as to ſay, That the Spirit of God hath been overcome, But they <hi>have rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit,</hi> Iſa. 63. 10. They have <hi>quenched the Spirit,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 19. for that thing may and hath been done, which we are there cautioned and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt) ſo that God doth declare, <hi>His Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man,</hi> that is, He will leave off Fighting and Contending with Man for to come to his Obedience, but give him over, for that he alſo is Fleſh, that is, wholly given unto <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Corruption,</hi> and to falling away and turning aſide. Yet his days ſhall be an hundred and twenty Years, and afterwards in the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> it is reduced to <hi>threeſcore and ten and fourſcore Years</hi> (ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.) whereby we are given to underſtand, and it is as much as if God ſhould ſay, whether Man will obey me or not, whether he will yield unto the ſtrivings of my Spirit, or provoke me to withdraw it, yet his days ſhall be near the ſame, he ſhall live out however the appointed Time according to the Age of a Man. And though the Multitude of the People, both Men and Women of all the former and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Generations, have done thus perverſly and contrariwiſe with God, <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh People and unwiſe, is he not thy Father that hath bought thee? Hath he not made and eſtabliſhed thee?</hi> Yet as he had one good and godly Family in the midſt of a whole ungodly and idolatrous Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, whom he was ſure of, and who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Mind, <hi>For I know</hi> Abraham <hi>that he will command his Children and his Houſhold after him,</hi>

                  <hi>and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord to do Juſtice and Judgment, that the Lord may bring upon</hi> Abraham <hi>that which he hath ſpoken of him;</hi> Gen. 18. 19. So amongſt ſo many rebellious and ſinful Generations of Men and Women, which have been ſucceſſively one after another ſince the World began, and the like is at this day, and it may be a very few more are to ſucceed; Yet after all theſe, God who <hi>calls the Generations from the beginning,</hi> Iſa. 41. 4. hath one peculiar Generation in his Eye; all of which, like <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father, in all their Families and Places, will take care that every one of them, not one excepted, ſhall keep the way of the Lord, <hi>To do Juſtice and Judgment, That the Lord may bring upon them all thoſe things which he hath afore ſpoken of in his Word,</hi> concerning the Times of Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, when <hi>Thy People ſhall be all Righteous, The Sinners ſhall be no more;</hi> When he will make <hi>an end of Tranſgreſſion, and bring in Everlaſting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> And that God hath ſuch a Generation in his Eye and fore-knowledge, is expreſſed in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 30, 31. on this wiſe, <hi>A Seed ſhall ſerve him; It ſhall be accounted to the Lord for a Generation. They ſhall come and ſhall declare his Righteouſneſs unto a People that ſhall be born, That he hath done this.</hi> So that as it was ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> He will command his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Houſhold after him: So they will teach their Children and Poſterity. <hi>They ſhall declare this unto a People that ſhall be born, That the Lord hath done this.</hi> VVhat is that? VVhy, when the whole Earth heretofore was Corrupt, Evil and gone aſide, he hath brought them all to rights again; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears and is manifeſt by that <hi>Seed</hi> then living upon the Face of the Earth which ſhall <hi>ſerve him.</hi>

               <p>And whereas heretofore, The People of ſome Generations and Countries did ſerve him for a ſpurt as we commonly expreſs it. Upon God's ſending forth ſome Judgment, <hi>The Inhabitants of the Earth did learn Righteouſneſs,</hi> or upon his doing ſome extraordinary and more than uſual thing in the VVorld, they would ſerve him earneſtly and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently for the preſent Seaſon, or for a few Days, VVeeks, Months or Years. But here was the fault and failure, that afterwards they would return again to their former Sin and Ungodlineſs, and to their Formal Cuſtomary VVorſhip. Though they did keep the Commandments indifferently well for a very little while, yet they did again quickly go aſide from the Commandments of God. And ſo things have gone on after this rate and manner ever ſince the Creation. But it will be better and otherwiſe, when thoſe Times of Univerſal Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſhall come from the pouring out of the Spirit of the Lord. <hi>They ſhall fear thee as long as the Sun and Moon endureth, throughout all Generations,</hi> Pſal. 72. 5.

God will bring them forth to ſhew only, and not for Uſe and Service; <hi>That this righteous and peaceable Generacion</hi> may juſt ſee what kinds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments their Fore-Fathers a <hi>Rebellious and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Generation</hi> did make uſe of to kill and deſtroy;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:102492:155"/> which they, who <hi>ſhall feed like Lambs after their manner,</hi> Iſa. 5. 17. will hardly believe without ſeeing them, that ever ſo much Violence and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief ſhould be in the Hearts of Men, or that ſuch Inſtruments of Cruelty and Deſtruction ſhould be found in their Habitations. But as the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that a Pot full of Manna ſhould be laid up before the Lord in their Generations, that they may ſee the <hi>Bread wherewith I have fed you in the Wilderneſs, when I brought you forth from the Land of Egypt,</hi> Exod. 16. 32, 33, 34. So it is convenient and requiſite, that ſome of each ſort of thoſe Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and devices of VVar ſhould be kept for a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, that the Generations following may juſt ſee, how it was with the Earth, when <hi>God Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Smith that bloweth the Coals in the Fire, and that bringeth forth an Inſtrument for his Work, and that had created the Waſter to deſtroy,</hi> Iſa. 54. 16. <hi>When at thy Rebuke, O God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>the Chariot and Horſe are caſt into a dead Sleep,</hi> Pſal. 76. 6. Never to awake out of it again. For it is before ſaid, <hi>The ſtout hearted are ſpoiled, they have ſlept their Sleep; they are bereaved and ſtript of thoſe Engines wherewith they did execute their Revenge and Terror in the Land of the Living.</hi> And now they <hi>have ſlept their ſleep;</hi> they have done all their do, which they muſt never do again. What they did then do was as much at random and uncertainty from the true and proper ends of Man's Life (which was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Preſervation, and not for the Deſtruction of others, and at laſt of themſelves by ſo doing) as Sleep is now different from Waking; for in Sleep we Dream and think confuſedly without the uſe of Reaſon and Knowledge. But they ſhall lye down
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:102492:155"/> together, they ſhall not riſe. There is an utter end of all that, they are extinct as Tow the Wrath of Man which did heretofore kindle all this, God ſhall reſtrain. <hi>Surely the Wrath of Man ſhall Praiſe thee: the remainder of Wrath ſhalt thou reſtrain,</hi> Pſal. 76. 10. So as it ſhall go no further, and then it will ſink and come to nothing of it ſelf. They are <hi>quenched as Tow.</hi> If it would begin to ſmoak again, God will take care to put it out that it ſhall burn no more. Where his Prophet uſes theſe kind of pertinent and ſignificative Phraſes, he immediately adds, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ye not the former things, neither conſider the things of old. Behold I will do a new thing, now it ſhall ſpring forth, ſhall ye not know it,</hi> Iſa 43. 18, 19. This is as much as if God ſhould ſay, Ye may juſt ſee and think of thoſe former things, but they are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of your Remembrance and Conſideration, in compariſon to that <hi>new thing</hi> which God will do, which ſhall be both more pleaſant Entertainment to the Minds of his Creatures; and it ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more ſatisfactory for them to be employ'd therein, than heretofore in making <hi>Preparations for War,</hi> or hearing tidings from the Camp. <hi>I will even make a way in the Wilderneſs and Rivers in the Deſert.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt ſeems here to allude unto the March of an Army with their Power; who being to paſs through a Wilderneſs or Deſarts, ſend thoſe before them to make way, as by cutting down the Woods and Briars, and making rough places plain, and removing great Stones or Rubbiſh. As alſo to guide and conduct them in the intricate way. As alſo to ſeek out Forage, Food and Water for Man and for Beaſt; if they can find out Springs and Rivers in the Deſert, wherein is leaſt likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

We may aſſuredly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and believe, That in the Reſurrection and Reſtitution of all things, God will moſt certainly

And that there will be a beginning and entrance into this Bleſſed State towards the latter days here on the Earth, when the Lord <hi>ſhall reign before his Ancients gloriouſly</hi> And all things ſhall exactly ſo come to paſs according as he hath aforeſpoken of in his word. <hi>When the Wolf alſo ſhall dwell with the Lamb,</hi> Iſa. 11. 6. and there ſhall be a Concordance and Agreement between the moſt fierce and devouring Natures of Men and Women, with the moſt calm, meek and peaceable Diſpoſitions, according to what is further written and confirmed. <hi>The Wolf and the Lamb ſhall feed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the Lion ſhall eat ſtraw like the Bullock, and duſt ſhall be the Serpents meat: They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my Holy Mountain, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 65. 25.</p>
               <p>To make way and prepare for this glorious day of univerſal Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, is the end of all our Preaching and Writing, and laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men and VVomen all the <hi>Words of Truth</hi> which we can. <hi>The Lord ſaith, I will come near to you to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Mal. 3. 5. So according to the goings forth and Emanations of his Eternal Truth, God doth come nearer to the Children of Men, both for Good and Comfort to his Saints and Servants, as alſo for Terror and Puniſhment to the Ungodly and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient. <hi>For that thy Name is near, Thy wondrous Works declare,</hi> Pſal. 75. 11. God in Scripture is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaid to be afar off, and he is inviſible. So that he cannot be otherwiſe ſhewn forth and made known unto others, but in his VVorks and by his Name. Both which are declared by fit, proper and true words. So that the Reader need not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:102492:161"/> at the multitude of them here uſed, if they help to make the inviſible God more known unto the Inhabitants of the Earth, and render him as it were viſible, yea and ſenſible unto their Souls.

If Righteouſneſs and Holineſs were ingrafted into the Hearts of all Men, ſo that they did live and were led by it at all times and in all places, The <hi>Spirit of God would dwell in them,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 16. <hi>As God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them and walk in them, and I will be their God and they ſhall be my People. And I will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord God Almighty,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 16, 18. VVhat is requiſite to all this we may read in the firſt Verſe of the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Having therefore theſe Promiſes</hi> (both thoſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned are included, for it is expreſſed in the plural number) <hi>let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Fleſh and Spirit, Perfecting Holineſs in the Fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. <hi>Be ye clean ye that bear the Veſſels of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 52. 11. And from what is written, <hi>Thou haſt taken Captivity Captive.</hi> VVe learn that God hath taken even Sin and Corruption Captive, which heretofore did hold the Children of Men in Slavery and Captivity. But when every Thought in them alſo is brought into Captivity unto the Obedience of Chriſt, God will plant ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:102492:162"/> elſe in the room thereof, <hi>Thou haſt received Gifts for Men,</hi> (even the qualifications of his Grace, and the fruits of his Spirit) <hi>Yea, for the Rebellious alſo, that the Lord God might dwell among them,</hi> Pſal. 68. 18. So that though Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have been Rebellious and Diſobedient for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; yet when thoſe <hi>Rebellious</hi> Thoughts and Imaginations are brought into Captivity, when the <hi>Gifts of God</hi> are firſt lodged in the Soul, to make it ready and meet beforehand, the Lord God himſelf will come and dwell amongſt them alſo.</p>
               <p>So that whereas it was before mentioned, <hi>And the Lord ſaid, My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man, for that he alſo is Fleſh,</hi> Gen. 6. 3. And the reaſon hereof was aſſigned becauſe the Fleſh did ſo very often overcome the Spirit, when the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men did <hi>Rebel,</hi> and <hi>Vex,</hi> and <hi>Grieve</hi> and <hi>Quench</hi> the Spirit; yet the Bleſſing and Saying of <hi>Gad</hi> is made good, and herein is found true, <hi>A Troop ſhall overcome him, but he ſhall overcome at laſt,</hi> Gen. 49. 19. So a Troop of Luſts and a Legion (for they are many) of Temptations have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Spirit, but the <hi>Spirt ſhall overcome them at laſt.</hi> And the Spirit ſhall have that Dominion and Prevalency in the hearts of all Men, that all its Dictates and Motions ſhall be ſo willingly and immediately obeyed and complied withal, that there ſhall be no ſtriving of the Spirit with Man; for he ſhall forthwith and preſently go as that commands him to go, and come as that bids him to come, and do this or that according as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſaith, without any ſuch thing as Reaſoning and Perſwaſion, or ſtriving in the Heart, for there will
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:102492:162"/> not be the leaſt Reluctancy or Unwillingneſs. God who ſees and knows the things afar off, doth fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee this alſo; that even Fleſh will become ſo Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, that they ſhall obey all his Commands, and execute his Statutes, without any ſtriving of the Spirit, but only upon the firſt motion and making of it known unto their Hearts.</p>

In this ſence alſo.

God hath made and ordained, that it ſhall be ſo; that the Heavens ſhall drop down the things contained therein.

               <p>But wherefore is it that we hear ſo very much that in the laſt days of all, <hi>God will pour out his Spirit upon us from on High,</hi> Iſa. 32. 15. <hi>For I will pour Water upon him that is Thirſty and Floods upon the dry Ground: I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Bleſſing upon thine Off-ſpring,</hi> Iſa 44. 3. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs afterward (in the laſt days ſaith God,</hi> Acts 2. 17.) <hi>that I will pour out out my Spirit upon all Fleſh,</hi> Joel, 2. 28.

But we read not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo much of the VVord then as aforetime. Beſides that, the VVord is in Order and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Time before the Spirit; for Jeſus Chriſt came firſt into the Fleſh, and then afterward the Holy Ghoſt was given according to that Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Remark of one of the Inſpired VVriters; for the <hi>Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet Glorified.</hi> Another great Reaſon hereof may be aſſigned, That as the <hi>Angel ſware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created Heaven and the things that therein are, and the Earth and the things that therein are, and the Sea and the things which are therein, that there ſhould be Time no longer,</hi> Rev. 10. 16. For Time will be loſt and ſwallow'd up in Eternity, as a River or Brook is now loſt when it empties it ſelf into the wide Ocean: So we may eaſily gather and underſtand, that when all theſe things here mentioned, ſhall be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and wholly made known and ſeen face to face; when what is now afar off and Future, ſhall be Preſent and juſt before us; when Faith ſhall be turned into Viſion, and Hope into Fruition, when <hi>Propheſies ſhall fail, Tongues ceaſe, and Knowledge</hi>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:102492:164"/> 
                  <hi>ſhall vaniſh away:</hi> VVhen the whole Creation of God ſhall be new and changed from material and ſenſible things, into Spiritual, then we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude alſo, That <hi>WORDS ſhall be NO LONGER.</hi> But the things themſelves (heretofore expreſſed and apprehended by them) ſhall ſucceed and be given unto the Creatures. God doth all things <hi>in his own Order.</hi> He firſt made known unto his Creatures the <hi>Words of Eternal Life,</hi> and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he inveſts them with the thing it ſelf of Eternal Life; and then it is conſequent that the words thereof ſhould ceaſe and fail, as the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold falls down, or is taken away when the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is Perfected and quite Finiſhed. Like as now in common Life there is great talk of ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's coming, as of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> among the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Jews; but when he is come indeed, then all that talk periſheth which did relate thereto. <hi>For ſince the beginning of the World Men have not heard nor perceived by the Ear, neither hath the Eye ſeen, O God beſides thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him,</hi> Iſa. 64. 4. But when that great and enduring thing ſhall be actually given to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by that God whom he hath waited for, then all the thoughts of Heart and words of Mouth that were before concerning it, will ceaſe and come to an utter end. VVhat Truth we now ſee written in a dead Letter, or we hear in an outward Airy Sound, or we conceive in our Mind, will one day appear as a ſhining Ray of Light. For <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth make manifeſt is Light,</hi> Eph. 5. 13. And all things then will appear in the Light of the Lord.</p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:102492:165"/>
               <p>And ſo this great Matter which we are contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for all along and perſwading People unto, ſhall be inſtantly and altogether done by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. So that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Strivings of the People,</hi> and be <hi>made the Head of the Heathen,</hi> and <hi>a People whom he hath not known ſhall ſerve him. As ſoon as they hear of him, they ſhall Obey him.</hi> So that there is not need of many more words to enforce the Exhortation. But by VVords, Knowledge, or Notice hath been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that one day ſo it ſhall be; for all things which are written in the Scriptures of Truth muſt be fulfilled. And alſo there is this further benefit and uſe of words, that we are hereby taught and put in mind to be in a Readineſs and Preparation for the ſame. The VVord doth convert Sinners from the Error of their way, like the droppings of Rain, or the diſtillings of Dew; that is, it doth now and then bring in ſome individual Perſons; and that alſo is done by degrees and in ſucceſſion of time. <hi>But the pouring out of the Spirit from on High,</hi> ſhall bring them in by ſhoals and multitudes, and do the VVork <hi>Inſtantly</hi> and Immediately. <hi>As ſoon as they hear of me they ſhall Obey me.</hi> Then thou <hi>ſhalt ſee and flow together, and thine Heart ſhall fear and be enlarged, becauſe the abundance of the Sea ſhall be converted unto thee, the Forces of the Gentiles ſhall come unto thee. The Multitude of Camels ſhall cover thee. All the Flocks of</hi> Kedar <hi>ſhall be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto thee. Who are theſe that fly as a Cloud, and as the Doves to their Windows,</hi> Iſa. 60. 5, 6, 7, 8. By all which kinds of Speech we are given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that very many in number ſhall flow and come over and be Converted unto God. And
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:102492:165"/> 
                  <hi>the Sons of Strangers ſhall build up thy Walls.</hi> This is near to the ſame purport and meaning as what is ſaid in our great Scripture; out of which I have here opened and alledged things all along. The <hi>Strangert ſhall ſubmit themſelves unto thee: The Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſhall fade away, and be afraid out of their cloſe Places.</hi> Thoſe are <hi>Strangers</hi> who before had not known God nor Chriſt. For although known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God are all Men and Women as they are his Creatures; yet God and Chriſt doth not know them as to be in Covenant with them; <hi>I never knew ye, depart from me ye that work Iniquity,</hi> Matt. 7. 23. But they remain <hi>Aliens from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Iſrael, who are without Hope, without God in the World.</hi> And yet here is the aſſured Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that theſe ſhall come to be acquainted and ſubmit themſelves (that is to yield Obedience) unto God and his Chriſt, according to what he hath afore ſpoken of in another Scripture, <hi>I will ſay to them which were not my People, Thou art my People, and they ſhall ſay, Thou art my God,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Strangers ſhall fade away and be afraid out of their cloſe Places.</hi> Beſides that abundant Converſion of them at laſt; thoſe which ſhall be converted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall ſo <hi>fade away</hi> and come off from their former Strangeneſs towards God, as that it ſhall not be perceived: Like Men Aſhamed, which Steal and flee from Battel, ſo they ſhall be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their former Ungodlineſs and ſinful do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. So that they would rather ſeem on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as if they had obeyed and ſerved God from the very firſt. When theſe come to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and to believe a future State and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:102492:166"/> of Happineſs and Miſery, they ſhall look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout how to make ſure for themſelves that they may be happy and ſure therein: And they ſhall be afraid out of their cloſe Places, or of thoſe Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations and Deceits in which heretofore they tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and built a falſe Hope on. Thou putteſt away all the wicked of the Earth (obſerve the Particle <hi>All</hi>) <hi>like Droſs,</hi> Pſal. 119. 119. <hi>As wax melteth before the Fire, ſo let the Wicked periſh at the preſence of God,</hi> Pſal. 68. 2. All this will be done more ſuddenly and as it were at an inſtant, when the times of <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Reformation</hi> come on, and God doth <hi>bow the Heavens and come down,</hi> and he <hi>poureth out his Spirit upon all Fleſh;</hi> Then all VVickedneſs will ſo vaniſh and diſappear, that the place thereof ſhall know it no more, and it will ſeem as if there had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any ſuch thing on the Earth. All that groſs Darkneſs and Error will be utterly and for ever gone off from the face of it, when this true Light ſhall begin to ſhine univerſally and openly in all the habitable parts thereof. <hi>The People ſhall then ſhew forth their Zeal for the Lord God of Hoſts;</hi> VVho is he that ſaid but ſo much as in his Heart, Shall the inviſible God reign over me? Or ſhall I obey his ſtanding and written word? Let theſe People be brought forth, that the Saints of the moſt High may inflict ſome Puniſhment on them. But they ſhall not do it in the leaſt, <hi>For Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompence, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And again, <hi>The Lord ſhall judge his People,</hi> Heb. 10. 30. Deut. 32. 35, 36. And the Lord will not begin to execute it then preſently, when he is glorified in his Saints, <hi>and had in Honour by all that are round about him.</hi> As an unknown Malefactor amongſt a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:102492:166"/> of People when he is asked for, who did ſuch a Theft or Murther: Which being known and evident, muſt be concluded that ſome one did it, he is ſure to keep Silence and ſeem all one as the other innocent Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, leſt he ſhould be betrayed and diſcovered. In like manner it will be when the Lord ſhall Plead with the Inhabitants of the Earth (who will be a vaſt number gathered together of all Generations and Countries) and he <hi>maketh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition</hi> for ſo much Sin, Iniquity, Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Wickedneſs as hath been actually done on the Earth. So much hath been committed, and it muſt have been by ſome Perſons, Who was it by Name that did it? <hi>Then ſhall they be exceeding ſorrowful and afraid, and begin every one of them to ſay, Lord, is it I?</hi> The particular Guilty themſelves ſhall keep Silence, and they ſhall be found <hi>Speechleſs,</hi> Matt. 22. 12. Or if they are asked as concerning another Matter, then they will perhaps ſpeak out or deny, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to wave and take of the ſuſpicion of that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo whereof they were indeed Guilty. In that day there will hardly be found any who will own themſelves to have been amongſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Adverſaries of the Lord. <hi>The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of the Lord ſhall be aſhamed;</hi> which as they ſhall be then conſcious of themſelves, ſo they will endeavour to hide it as much as they can. <hi>But they ſhall be afraid out of their cloſe Places of ſhelter and abſconding,</hi> whether it be the <hi>Clefts of the Rocks,</hi> or the <hi>Holes of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:102492:167"/> For though their Fellow Creatures would be puzled hereby end be at a loſs and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to whom to aſſign ſuch hidden things of Diſhoneſty, or many ſecret acts of Sin and Wickedneſs. And when even the Perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who committed the ſame, ſhall make ſuch a goodly outward ſhew of having Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, Honoured and ſerved the Lord, and they not knowing the limits of his Mercy, nor the periods of Time of holding forth his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Grace; nor yet diſcerning (for the Heart of every one is deep) the reality and ſincerity of their Repentance; it is hence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that they ſhould either find out or judge Righteouſly, and render accordingly to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral People. But the Judge of all the Earth will do Right. He is not as Man, but a <hi>God of Knowledge, by whom Actions are weighed,</hi> 1 Som. 2. 3. Who ſees Hearts as clearly as we ſee the outward Faces; and he knows things long ſince paſt, or yet to come, as we do the preſent Moment. In oppoſition to their Hiding, Concealing and Diſſembling, Thine hand ſhall find out all thine Enemies, <hi>Thy Right hand ſhall find out thoſe that hate thee; thou ſhalt make them as a fiery Oven in the time of thine Anger, the Lord ſhall ſwallow them up in his Wrath, and the Fire ſhall devour them,</hi> Pſal. 21. 8, He will firſt find and ſet them out, and then afterwards take his own time to puniſh them. According to that Divine Method, <hi>Having a mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge all Diſobedience, when your Obedience is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</hi> So he will firſt have that <hi>Seed which ſhall</hi>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:102492:167"/> 
                  <hi>ſerve him, It ſhall be accounted to the Lord for a Generation.</hi> And when the days of their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Service are fulfilled, then he will begin to call to account the former Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For it is firſt ſaid <hi>Zion ſhall be redeemed with Judgment, and her Converts with Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſneſs, and then afterwards it follows, And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Tranſgreſſors and of the Sinners ſhall be together,</hi> Iſa. 1. 27, 28. <hi>And I will puniſh the World for their Evil, and the Wicked for their Iniquity,</hi> Iſa. 13. 11. But like as it is written, <hi>I will leave a few Men of them from the Sword and from the Peſtilence, that they may declare all their Abominations among the Heathen, whither they come, and they ſhall know that I am the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 12. 16. So here it may be ſuppoſed, that God will have one Righteous Generation after ſo many Rebellious and Sinful ones; that by comparing both thoſe Contraries together (I do here ſpeak after the manner of Men) He may know how to proceed to Recompence, and Puniſhment. We read, that when <hi>God ſaw that the wickedneſs of Man was great in the Earth, it repented the Lord that he had made Man upon the Earth, and it grieved him at his Heart,</hi> Gen. 6. 5, 6. But after that the <hi>Lord ſmelled a ſweet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and the Lord ſaid in his Heart, I will not again curſe the Ground any more for Man's ſake; for the Imagination of Man's Heart is evil from his Youth; neither will I again ſmite any more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing Living, as I have done,</hi> Gen. 8. 21. This was ſaid upon <hi>Noah,</hi> (a Righteous and Perfect Man) his building an Altar <hi>unto the Lord</hi>

                  <hi>and offering burnt Offerings on that Altar.</hi> So that we ſee and find that it fares better with the wicked World for the ſake of the Righteous. And after the ſame ſimilitude of things we may conceive, that when the Lord hath been long and ſore diſpleaſed with the Heathen of former Generations who were at Eaſe (under which word Heathen are compriſed all thoſe who know not, or who obey not the Lord) when the Earth was much corrup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pon it, ſo that it became as a Smoak or Stink in his Noſtrils. <hi>(When the Houſe of Iſrael dwelt in their own Land, they defiled it by their Ways and by their doings: Their way was before me as the unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Removed Woman,</hi> Ezek. 30. 17. After God hath born with this a long time, then comes and ſucceeds the <hi>Righteous Generation,</hi> who <hi>build an Altar</hi> and <hi>offer Burnt Offerings on that Altar,</hi> which like Frankinſence and Myrrh doth take away all the former Stink that the Lord <hi>doth ſmell a ſweet Savour from them;</hi> whereupon he doth abate and mitigate ſomewhat from that intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Puniſhment which he had before thought to lay and inflict on the wicked World; That he will not ſtir up all his Wrath, nor yet pour on them all and the utmoſt Evil, which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purpoſed to have done. Though withal, by ſeeing the exceeding Goodneſs of the one, compared with the Exceeding Sinfulneſs, Evil and Provocation of former Generations, it is neceſſary that ſome Puniſhment and Vengeance
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:102492:168"/> be actually inflicted on them, <hi>For the day of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is in mine Heart.</hi> (Hereby is denoted the futurity thereof, and that it is to ſucceed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other) <hi>and the Year of my Redeemed is come,</hi> Iſa. 63. 4. Which being expreſſed in the Preſent Tenſe, though it is ſpoken of after the other, yet in order of time, it will be before that; to which agrees the Goſpel, And <hi>the Dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt,</hi> Theſſ. 4. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For it is the day of the Lord's Vengeance, and the Year of Recompences for the controverſie of Sion,</hi> Iſa. 34. 8. What is this <hi>controverſie of Sion?</hi> It is even the Lord's Controverſie with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Earth, That all, both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile, Heathen,</hi> and all other People, of every Nation, Country and Language, and of every Generation, ſhould obey him the Lord their God. And here it comes to paſs that ſome do Obey him and ſome do not; from whence it is appoſitely ſtiled Recompences in the Plural Number, there being two ſorts of them, that is to ſay, a Recompence of Good to thoſe that ſhall be found to have Obeyed him, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Evil to ſuch who have not Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; <hi>For the Lord God of Recompences ſhall ſurely requite,</hi> Jer. 51. 56. To all People of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Country, Kindred and time, one of theſe two ways. So that in ſhort, if People do not Obey God, it is a <hi>Controverſie,</hi> which will be decided to their own Miſery, as themſelves will find in the day of the <hi>Lord's Vengeance.</hi> But if they do obey him (unto which knowing the Terrors

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Controverſie</hi> the Lord hath been plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Men and Women by his Word and Spirit; by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Evangeliſts, Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers, Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> ever ſince Man was firſt Created on the Earth.

And whilſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of my Soul is to this, and the ſame is the endeavour of my Hands, it is a well-grounded hope and aſſurance, that both my ſelf and my Works may be accepted of the Lord. <hi>If the Lord who hath the reſidue of the Spirit,</hi> Mal. 2. 15. doth ſtir up others alſo in like manner as he hath done mine, This may ſomewhat prepare and make way for the <hi>

And when the Prophet doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards complain, <hi>I have ſpread out my hands all the day unto a Rebellious People,</hi> He ſaith the firſt of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but this laſt and worſt Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he gives of the <hi>Jews.</hi> By which is intimated forth and confirmed that old and true Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, That as good People do commonly meet with more Kindneſs and Civility from meer Strangers than from Acquaintance and Kinsfolks: So it is a more eaſie matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and bring over unto God meer Heathen
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:102492:171"/> and Infidels, than to Reform obſtinate Jews, ſuperſtitious or formal Chriſtians, from the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of their ways, and to bring them off from their vain and ſinful Cuſtoms. So God ſpeaks unto <hi>Ezekiel, Son of Man go get thee unto the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſpeak with my Words unto them, for thou art not ſent unto a People of a ſtrange Speech, and of an hard Language, whoſe Words thou canſt not underſtand; Surely had I ſent thee unto them, they would have hearkened unto thee. But the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>will not hearken unto thee, for they will not hearken unto me,</hi> Ezek 3. 4, 5, 6, 7. And ſo God doth elſewhere take notice how they did <hi>Pollute his Name among the Heathen,</hi> which before was Sanctified among them. It is a more eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to inſtruct them in the true Knowledge of God who never heard of him before, then it is to them who have heard him Preached and Talked of all their Lives long, and yet they have not the Knowledge of God. <hi>I ſpeak this to their ſhame:</hi> For manyſuch are found to be in this Chriſtian Nation, who know nothing more of him than in a general way, what they have heard only with the outward Ear, or they have received in falſe Notions and Apprehenſions concerning him; for in this caſe ſo many things muſt be unlearned again, and ſo many Errors muſt be removed out before the Truth can come in; That one who is a pure Man, not before prepoſſeſſed with wrong Imaginations, but hath the common Principles of Nature and Powers of Knowledge, when ſuch an one is inſtructed
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:102492:171"/> truly and perfectly in the ways of God, he will forthwith aſſent unto them, and he will judge it the moſt reaſonable thing in the World to do according to what is written, <hi>At that day ſhall a Man look to his Maker, and his Eyes ſhall have reſpect unto the Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 17. 7. That Mortal Man ſhould be Subject and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto the Almighty and everlaſting God; for a Creature to be Governed by his Creator; eſpecially when he ſees, hears and finds it in his Heart to be enforced with that Demonſtration and Power as it may be: <hi>As ſoon as they hear of me they ſhall Obey me. The Strangers ſhall ſubmit themſelves unto me: The Strangers ſhall fade away and be afraid out of their cloſe Places.</hi> There is a manifold Wiſdom of God, and ſo there is a manifold Senſe and Interpretation of his Word, (which yet is all true and genuine) ſo beſides that meaning of the word <hi>Strangers,</hi> before aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned: There may be intended alſo ſuch as are Jews, Chriſtians, and Servants of God in Name or Profeſſion only; for they are <hi>Strangers or ſtrange Children,</hi> Pſal. 144. 7. Who pretend and ſeem outwardly to own and ſerve God, when indeed and in truth they do not ſerve and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him. Whatever Thoughts, Deceits, or falſe Imaginations ſuch have in their Minds; they ſhall fade and come off from them, and they ſhall be afraid thereof, when the Earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, and of the things pertaining to his Kingdom; all their own Reaſonings and Imaginations ſhall Vaniſh and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:102492:172"/> be utterly Aboliſhed, and every High thing that heretofore exalted it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God, ſhall be caſt down and fall to the Ground, that the Lord alone may be exalted in that day, and every thought both in Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will be brought into Captivity unto the Obedience of Chriſt. <hi>As ſoon as they hear of me, they ſhall Obey me.</hi>

                  <p>THE Wickedneſs and Rebellion of former Generations did endeavour to Dethrone God and Chriſt.
